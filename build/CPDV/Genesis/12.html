And when they arrived in it</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">Abram passed through the land even to the place of Shechem, as far as the famous steep valley. Now at that time, the Canaanite was in the land</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then the Lord appeared to Abram, and he said to him, “To your offspring, I will give this land.” And there he built an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">And passing on from there to a mountain, which was opposite the east of Bethel, he pitched his tent there, having Bethel to the west, and Hai on the east.
