These you shall have as servants</li><li value="46" id="46" class="svelte-2su5mk">and, by the right of inheritance, you shall transmit them to your posterity, and you shall possess them forever. But do not oppress your brothers, the sons of Israel, by power</li><li value="47" id="47" class="svelte-2su5mk">If the hand of a newcomer or a sojourner will have grown strong among you, and your brother, having become impoverished, will have sold himself to him, or to any of his stock</li><li value="48" id="48" class="svelte-2su5mk">after the sale, he is able to be redeemed. Whoever is willing among his brothers shall redeem him</li><li value="49" id="49" class="svelte-2su5mk">either the paternal uncle, or the paternal uncle’s son, or his close relative, by blood or by affinity. But if he himself will be able also, he shall redeem himself</li><li value="50" id="50" class="svelte-2su5mk">considering only the years from the time of his selling until the year of the Jubilee, and calculating the money for which he was sold, according to the number of years and the accounting of a hired hand</li><li value="51" id="51" class="svelte-2su5mk">If there will have been many years which remain until the Jubilee, according to these shall he also repay the price</li><li value="52" id="52" class="svelte-2su5mk">If few, he shall determine the accounting with him according to the number of years, and he shall repay to the buyer by what is left remaining of the years</li><li value="53" id="53" class="svelte-2su5mk">his wages being charged by what served before. He shall not afflict him violently in your sight</li><li value="54" id="54" class="svelte-2su5mk">But if, by these means, he will not be able to be redeemed, then in the year of the Jubilee he shall depart with his children</li><li value="55" id="55" class="svelte-2su5mk">For they are my servants, the sons of Israel, whom I led away from the land of Egypt</li></ol>
