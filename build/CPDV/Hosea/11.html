For Israel was a child and I loved him; and out of Egypt I called my son</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">They called them, and so they departed before their face. They offered victims to the Baals, and they sacrificed to graven images</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I was like a foster father to Ephraim. I carried them in my arms. And they did not know that I healed them</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">I will draw them with the cords of Adam, with the bands of love. And I will be to them like one who raises the yoke over their jaws. And I will reach down to him so that he may eat</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">He will not return to the land of Egypt, but Assur himself will be the king over him, because they were not willing to be converted</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">The sword has begun in his cities, and it will consume his elect and devour their heads</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And my people will long for my return.

My heart has changed within me; together with my regret, it has been stirred up</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">I will not act on the fury of my wrath. I will not turn back to utterly destroy Ephraim. For I am God, and not man, the Divine in your midst, and I will not advance upon the city</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">They will walk after the Lord; he will roar like a lion. For he himself will roar, and the sons of the sea will dread</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they will fly like a bird out of Egypt, and like a dove from the land of the Assyrians. And I will arrange them in their own houses, says the Lord</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">Ephraim has besieged me with denials, and the house of Israel with deceit. But Judah went down as a witness before God and the holy ones of faith</li></ol>
