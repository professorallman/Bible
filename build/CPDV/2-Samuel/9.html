And when the king had called him to himself, he said to him, “Are you not Ziba?” And he responded, “I am your servant.</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the king said, “Could there be anyone alive from the house of Saul, so that I may show the mercy of God to him?” And Ziba said to the king, “There is left alive a son of Jonathan, with disabled feet.</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">“Where is he?” he said. And Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, king David sent and brought him from the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, had come to David, he fell upon his face, and he reverenced.
