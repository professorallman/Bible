<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam, Abijah reigned over Judah</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">He reigned for three years in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother was Micaiah, the daughter of Uriel, from Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when Abijah had undertaken the conflict, and he had with him four hundred thousand elect men, very fit for war, Jeroboam set up a battle line opposite him of eight hundred thousand men, who were also elect and very strong in warfare</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Abijah stood upon mount Zemaraim, which was in Ephraim, and he said: â€œListen to me, Jeroboam and all of Israel</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">Are you ignorant that the Lord, the God of Israel, gave David the kingship over Israel for all time, to him and to his sons, by a covenant of salt</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">But Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, the servant of Solomon, son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And there were gathered to him very vain men, and sons of Belial. And they prevailed against Rehoboam, the son of Solomon. For Rehoboam was inexperienced, and he had a fearful heart, and so he was unable to resist them</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now therefore, you say that you are able to resist the kingdom of the Lord, which he possesses through the sons of David, and you have a great multitude of people, and gold calves, which Jeroboam made for you as gods</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">And you have cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, as well as the Levites. And like all the peoples of the lands, you have made priests for yourselves. Anyone who is willing to come and perform the ritual by his hand, with a bull from the herd and with seven rams, is made a priest of those who are not gods</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the Lord is our God, and we have not forsaken him. And the priests who minister to the Lord are from the sons of Aaron. And the Levites are in their proper order</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">Also, they offer holocausts to the Lord, each and every day, morning and evening, and incense composed according to the precept of the law, and the bread of the presence on a very pure table. And there is with us the gold lampstand with its lamps, so that they may burn continually in the evening. For certainly, we keep the precepts of the Lord our God, whom you have forsaken</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, God is the commander of our army, with his priests, who sound the trumpets that ring out against you. O sons of Israel, do not choose to fight against the Lord, the God of your fathers. For it is not expedient for you.</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">While he was speaking these things, Jeroboam set in motion an ambush behind them. And while they stood facing the enemy, without Judah realizing it, his army circled around</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">And looking back, Judah saw the war threatening in front and behind, and they cried out to the Lord. And the priests began to sound the trumpets</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">And all the men of Judah shouted out. And behold, when they cried out, God terrified Jeroboam, and all of Israel who were standing in opposition to Abijah and Judah</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the sons of Israel fled from Judah, and the Lord delivered them into their hand</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, Abijah and his people struck them with a great slaughter. And five hundred thousand strong men of Israel fell wounded</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the sons of Israel were humiliated at that time. And the sons of Judah were very greatly strengthened, because they had trusted in the Lord, the God of their fathers</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Abijah pursued the fleeing Jeroboam. And he seized cities from him: Bethel and her daughters, and Jeshanah with her daughters, and also Ephron and her daughters</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Jeroboam no longer had the strength to resist, in the days of Abijah. And the Lord struck him, and he died</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so Abijah, having been strengthened in his authority, took fourteen wives. And he procreated twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now the rest of the words of Abijah, and his ways and works, have been written very diligently in the book of Iddo, the prophet</li></ol>
