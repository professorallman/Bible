He will lead forth judgment unto truth</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">He will not be saddened or troubled, until he establishes judgment on earth. And the islands will await his law</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">Thus says the Lord God, who created the heavens and expanded it, who formed the earth and all that springs from it, who gives breath to the people in it, and spirit to those walking on it</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">I, the Lord, have called you in justice, and I have taken your hand and preserved you. And I have presented you as a covenant of the people, as a light to the Gentiles</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">so that you may open the eyes of the blind, and lead out the prisoner from confinement and those sitting in darkness from the house of incarceration</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">I am the Lord; this is my name. I will not give my glory to another, nor my praise to graven things</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">The things that were first, behold, they have arrived. And I also announce what is new. Before these things arise, I will cause you to hear about them</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">Sing to the Lord a new canticle, sing his praise from the ends of the earth, you who descend into the sea and all its fullness, the islands and their inhabitants</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">Let the desert and its cities be lifted up. Kedar will dwell in houses. O inhabitants of the rock, give praise!

He will shout and cry out. He will prevail against his enemies</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">I have always been quiet; I have been silent; I have been patient.
