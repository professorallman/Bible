When you walk through fire, you will not be burned, and the flames will not scorch you</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Saviour. I have presented Egypt as your atonement, Ethiopia and Seba on your behalf</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">Since then, you have become honorable in my eyes, and glorious. I have loved you, and I will present men on behalf of you, and people on behalf of your life</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">Fear not, for I am with you. I will lead your offspring from the East, and I will gather you from the West</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">I will say to the North, “Release him,” and to the South, “Do not turn him away.” Bring my sons from far away, and my daughters from the ends of the earth</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And each one who calls upon my name, I have created for my glory.

I will make a way in the desert, and rivers in an impassible place</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">The wild beasts of the field will glorify me, with the serpents and the ostriches. For I have brought waters to the desert, rivers to inaccessible places, in order to give drink to my people, to my elect</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">This is the people whom I have formed for myself. They will speak my praise</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">But you have not called upon me, O Jacob, nor have you struggled for me, O Israel</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">You have not offered me the ram of your holocaust, and you have not glorified me with your victims.

I am the very One who wipes away your iniquities for my own sake. And I will not remember your sins</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">Call me to mind, and let us go to judgment together. If you have anything to justify yourself, explain it</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">Your first father sinned, and your interpreters have betrayed me</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, I have defiled the holy leaders. I have handed over Jacob to slaughter, and Israel to calumny</li></ol>
