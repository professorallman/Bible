And what do you want done? Even if you ask for half of my kingdom, you will obtain it.</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">She answered him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, O king, and if it pleases you, spare my soul, I ask you, and spare my people, I beg you</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">For I and my people have been handed over to be crushed, to be slain, and to perish.
