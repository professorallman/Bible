<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">ALEPH. I am a man watching my own poverty by the rod of his indignation</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">ALEPH. He has driven me and led me into darkness, and not into light</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">ALEPH. Against me only, he has turned and turned again his hand, all day long</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">BETH. My skin and my flesh, he has made old; he has crushed my bones</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">BETH. He has built all around me, and he has encircled me with gall and hardship</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">BETH. He has gathered me into darkness, like those who are forever dead</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">GHIMEL. He has built against me all around, so that I may not depart. He has increased the burden of my confinement</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">GHIMEL. Yet even when I cry out and beg, he excludes my prayer</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">GHIMEL. He has enclosed my ways with square stones; he has subverted my paths</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">DALETH. He has become to me like a bear lying in ambush, like a lion in hiding</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">DALETH. He has subverted my paths, and he has broken me. He has placed me in desolation</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">DALETH. He has bent his bow, and he has positioned me like a target for his arrows</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">HE. He has shot into my kidneys the daughters of his quiver</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">HE. I have become a derision to all my people, their song throughout the day</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">HE. He has filled me with bitterness; he has inebriated me with wormwood</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">VAU. And he has broken each one of my teeth; he has fed me with ashes</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">VAU. And my soul has been driven away from peace; I have forgotten what is good</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">VAU. And I said, “My end and my hope from the Lord has perished.</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">ZAIN. Remember my poverty and my transgression, the wormwood and the gall</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">ZAIN. I will call to mind the past, and my soul shall languish within me</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">ZAIN. These recollections are in my heart; therefore, I shall hope</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">HETH. By the mercies of the Lord, we are not consumed. For his compassion has not passed away</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">HETH. I know it at first light; great is your faithfulness</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">HETH. “The Lord is my portion,” said my soul. Because of this, I will wait for him</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">TETH. The Lord is good to those who hope in him, to the soul that seeks him</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">TETH. It is good to stand ready in silence for the salvation of God</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">TETH. It is good for a man, when he has carried the yoke from his youth</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">JOD. He shall sit solitary and silent. For he has lifted it upon himself</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">JOD. He shall place his mouth in the dirt, if perhaps there may be hope</li><li value="30" id="30" class="svelte-2su5mk">JOD. He shall give his cheek to those who strike him; he shall be saturated with reproaches</li><li value="31" id="31" class="svelte-2su5mk">CAPH. For the Lord will not rebuke forever</li><li value="32" id="32" class="svelte-2su5mk">CAPH. For, if he has cast down, he will also have compassion, according to the multitude of his mercies</li><li value="33" id="33" class="svelte-2su5mk">CAPH. For he has not humiliated from his heart, nor has he thrown aside the sons of men</li><li value="34" id="34" class="svelte-2su5mk">LAMED. as if to crush under his feet all the prisoners of the land</li><li value="35" id="35" class="svelte-2su5mk">LAMED. as if to turn aside the judgment of a man in the sight of the presence of the Most High</li><li value="36" id="36" class="svelte-2su5mk">LAMED. as if to pervert a man in his judgment: the Lord does not do this</li><li value="37" id="37" class="svelte-2su5mk">MEM. Who is this, who said to do what the Lord did not command</li><li value="38" id="38" class="svelte-2su5mk">MEM. Does not both misfortune and good proceed from the mouth of the Most High</li><li value="39" id="39" class="svelte-2su5mk">MEM. Why has a living man murmured, a man suffering for his sins</li><li value="40" id="40" class="svelte-2su5mk">NUN. Let us examine our ways, and seek out, and return to the Lord</li><li value="41" id="41" class="svelte-2su5mk">NUN. Let us lift up our hearts, with our hands, toward the Lord in the heavens</li><li value="42" id="42" class="svelte-2su5mk">NUN. We have acted sinfully, and we have provoked to wrath. About this, you are relentless</li><li value="43" id="43" class="svelte-2su5mk">SAMECH. You have covered us in your fury, and you have struck us. You have killed, and have not spared</li><li value="44" id="44" class="svelte-2su5mk">SAMECH. You have set a cloud opposite you, lest our prayer pass through</li><li value="45" id="45" class="svelte-2su5mk">SAMECH. In the midst of the peoples, you have uprooted me and cast me out</li><li value="46" id="46" class="svelte-2su5mk">PHE. All our enemies have opened their mouths over us</li><li value="47" id="47" class="svelte-2su5mk">PHE. Prediction has become for us a dread, and a snare, and a grief</li><li value="48" id="48" class="svelte-2su5mk">PHE. My eye has brought forth streams of water at the contrition of the daughter of my people</li><li value="49" id="49" class="svelte-2su5mk">AIN. My eye has been afflicted, and it has not been quieted, because there would be no res</li><li value="50" id="50" class="svelte-2su5mk">AIN. until the Lord looked down and saw from the heavens</li><li value="51" id="51" class="svelte-2su5mk">AIN. My eye has exhausted my soul over every one of the daughters of my city</li><li value="52" id="52" class="svelte-2su5mk">SADE. My enemies have chased me, and they have caught me like a bird, without reason</li><li value="53" id="53" class="svelte-2su5mk">SADE. My life has fallen into a pit, and they have placed a stone over me</li><li value="54" id="54" class="svelte-2su5mk">SADE. The waters have flooded over my head. I said, “I am lost.</li><li value="55" id="55" class="svelte-2su5mk">COPH. I called upon your name, O Lord, from the furthest pit</li><li value="56" id="56" class="svelte-2su5mk">COPH. You have heard my voice. Do not turn away your ear from my sobbing and my cries</li><li value="57" id="57" class="svelte-2su5mk">COPH. You drew near in the daytime, when I called upon you. You said, “Fear not.</li><li value="58" id="58" class="svelte-2su5mk">RES. You have judged, O Lord, the case of my soul. You are the Redeemer of my life</li><li value="59" id="59" class="svelte-2su5mk">RES. You have seen, O Lord, their iniquity against me. Judge my case</li><li value="60" id="60" class="svelte-2su5mk">RES. You have seen all their fury, every one of their thoughts is against me</li><li value="61" id="61" class="svelte-2su5mk">SIN. You have heard their reproach, O Lord, all their thoughts are against me</li><li value="62" id="62" class="svelte-2su5mk">SIN. The lips of those who rise up against me, and their meditations, are against me all day long</li><li value="63" id="63" class="svelte-2su5mk">SIN. Watch their sitting down and their rising up: I am their psalm</li><li value="64" id="64" class="svelte-2su5mk">THAU. You shall pay a recompense to them, O Lord, according to the works of their hands</li><li value="65" id="65" class="svelte-2su5mk">THAU. You shall give them a heavy shield of the heart: your hardship</li><li value="66" id="66" class="svelte-2su5mk">THAU. You shall pursue them in fury, and you shall destroy them under the heavens, O Lord</li></ol>
