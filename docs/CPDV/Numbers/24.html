But directing his face opposite the desert</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">and lifting up his eyes, he saw Israel dwelling in tents by their tribes. And with the Spirit of God rushing into him</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">taking up his parable, he said: “Balaam, the son of Beor, the man whose eye has been obstructed</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">the hearer of the sermon of God, he who has gazed upon a vision of the Almighty, he who falls down and so his eyes are opened, has declared</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">‘How beautiful are your tabernacles, O Jacob, and your tents, O Israel</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">They are like forested valleys, like gardens irrigated next to rivers, like tabernacles which the Lord has fixed, like cedars close to waters</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">Water shall flow from his jar, and his offspring shall be amid many waters, because Agag, his king, shall be taken, and his kingdom shall be removed</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">Away from Egypt, God has led him, whose strength is like the rhinoceros.
