Then you and your sons shall minister in the tabernacle of the testimony</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the Levites shall stand watch by your precepts, and for all the works of the tabernacle; yet in such a manner that they shall not approach the vessels of the Sanctuary and of the altar, lest both they die, and you perish, at the same time</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">But they may be with you, and they may watch over the care of the tabernacle and all its ceremonies. A foreigner shall not be mixed with you</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">Watch over the care of the Sanctuary, and over the ministry of the altar, lest an indignation may rise over the sons of Israel</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">I have given your brothers, the Levites, to you from the midst of the sons of Israel, and I have delivered them as a gift to the Lord, in order to serve in the ministries of his tabernacle</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">But as for you and your sons: guard the priesthood. For all that pertains to the service of the altar and of what is beyond the veil shall be exercised by the priests. If any outsider will approach, he shall be killed.</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the Lord said to Aaron: “Behold, I have given you custody of my first-fruits. Everything that is sanctified by the sons of Israel I have delivered to you and your sons, for the office of the priesthood, by everlasting ordinances</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, you shall receive these, from the things that are sanctified and offered to the Lord.

And every animal that is unclean you shall cause to be redeemed</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">And its redemption shall be, after one month, five shekels of silver, by the weight of the Sanctuary. A shekel has twenty obols</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the firstborn of a cow, or of a sheep, or of a goat, you shall not cause to be redeemed, because they have been sanctified to the Lord. Thus, their blood you shall pour out upon the altar, and their fat you shall burn as a most sweet odor to the Lord</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">Yet truly, the flesh shall fall to your use, just as the consecrated breast and the right shoulder shall be yours</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">All the first-fruits of the Sanctuary, which the sons of Israel offer to the Lord, I have given to you and to your sons as well as to your daughters, as a perpetual right.
