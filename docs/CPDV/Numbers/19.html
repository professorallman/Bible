Instruct the sons of Israel, so that they may bring to you a red cow of full maturity, in which there is no blemish, and which has not carried a yoke</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">And you shall deliver it to Eleazar the priest, who, having led it out beyond the camp, shall immolate it in the sight of all</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">And dipping his finger in its blood, he shall sprinkle it seven times, opposite the door of the tabernacle</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he shall burn it, while all are watching, delivering into the flame, not only its skin and flesh, but also the blood and dung</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">Likewise, cedar wood, and hyssop, and twice-dyed scarlet he shall cast into the flame, by which the cow is consumed</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And then finally, having washed his garments and his body, he shall enter into the camp, and he shall be deeply stained until evening</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then he also who had burned it shall wash his garments and his body, and he shall be unclean until evening</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then a clean man shall gather the ashes of the cow, and he shall pour them out beyond the camp, in a very pure place, so that they may be preserved for the multitude of the sons of Israel, and for the water of aspersion, because the cow was burned for sin</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when he who had carried the ashes of the cow will have washed his garments, he shall be unclean until evening. The sons of Israel, and the newcomers who live among them, shall have this as a holy and perpetual right</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">Whoever touches the corpse of a man, and is, because of this, unclean for seven days</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">shall be sprinkled from this water on the third and seventh days, and so shall he be cleansed.

And having been expiated on the seventh day, he shall wash both himself and his garments, and he shall be unclean until evening</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">If anyone has not been expiated by this ritual, his soul shall perish from the midst of the Church. For he has polluted the Sanctuary of the Lord, and he has not been sprinkled with purifying waters</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">This precept shall be an everlasting ordinance. Likewise, the one who has sprinkled the waters shall wash his garments.
