<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">I am speaking the truth in Christ; I am not lying. My conscience offers testimony to me in the Holy Spirit</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">because the sadness within me is great, and there is a continuous sorrow in my heart</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">For I was desiring that I myself might be anathemized from Christ, for the sake of my brothers, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">These are the Israelites, to whom belongs adoption as sons, and the glory and the testament, and the giving and following of the law, and the promises</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">Theirs are the fathers, and from them, according to the flesh, is the Christ, who is over all things, blessed God, for all eternity. Amen</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">But it is not that the Word of God has perished. For not all those who are Israelites are of Israel</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And not all sons are the offspring of Abraham: “For your offspring will be invoked in Isaac.</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">In other words, those who are the sons of God are not those who are sons of the flesh, but those who are sons of the Promise; these are considered to be the offspring</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">For the word of promise is this: “I will return at the proper time. And there shall be a son for Sarah.</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">And she was not alone. For Rebecca also, having conceived by Isaac our father, from one act</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">when the children had not yet been born, and had not yet done anything good or bad (such that the purpose of God might be based on their choice)</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">and not because of deeds, but because of a calling, it was said to her: “The elder shall serve the younger.</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">So also it was written: “I have loved Jacob, but I have hated Esau.</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">What should we say next? Is there unfairness with God? Let it not be so</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">For to Moses he says: “I will pity whomever I pity. And I will offer mercy to whomever I will pity.</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, it is not based on those who choose, nor on those who excel, but on God who takes pity</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">For Scripture says to the Pharaoh: “I have raised you up for this purpose, so that I may reveal my power by you, and so that my name may be announced to all the earth.</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, he takes pity on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, you would say to me: “Then why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">O man, who are you to question God? How can the thing that has been formed say to the One who formed him: “Why have you made me this way?</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">And does not the potter have the authority over the clay to make, from the same material, indeed, one vessel unto honor, yet truly another unto disgrace</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">What if God, wanting to reveal his wrath and to make his power known, endured, with much patience, vessels deserving wrath, fit to be destroyed</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">so that he might reveal the wealth of his glory, within these vessels of mercy, which he has prepared unto glory</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so it is with those of us whom he has also called, not only from among the Jews, but even from among the Gentiles</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">just as he says in Hosea: “I will call those who were not my people, ‘my people,’ and she who was not beloved, ‘beloved,’ and she who had not obtained mercy, ‘one who has obtained mercy.</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">And this shall be: in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ there they shall be called the sons of the living God.</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Isaiah cried out on behalf of Israel: “When the number of the sons of Israel is like the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">For he shall complete his word, while abbreviating it out of equity. For the Lord shall accomplish a brief word upon the earth.</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">And it is just as Isaiah predicted: “Unless the Lord of hosts had bequeathed offspring, we would have become like Sodom, and we would have been made similar to Gomorrah.</li><li value="30" id="30" class="svelte-2su5mk">What should we say next? That the Gentiles who did not follow justice have attained justice, even the justice that is of faith</li><li value="31" id="31" class="svelte-2su5mk">Yet truly, Israel, though following the law of justice, has not arrived at the law of justice</li><li value="32" id="32" class="svelte-2su5mk">Why is this? Because they did not seek it from faith, but as if it were from works. For they stumbled over a stumbling block</li><li value="33" id="33" class="svelte-2su5mk">just as it was written: “Behold, I am placing a stumbling block in Zion, and a rock of scandal. But whoever believes in him shall not be confounded.</li></ol>
