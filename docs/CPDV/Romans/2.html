<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">For this reason, O man, each one of you who judges is inexcusable. For by that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you do the same things that you judge</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">For we know that the judgment of God is in accord with truth against those who do such things</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">But, O man, when you judge those who do such things as you yourself also do, do you think that you will escape the judgment of God</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">Or do you despise the riches of his goodness and patience and forbearance? Do you not know that the kindness of God is calling you to repentance</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">But in accord with your hard and impenitent heart, you store up wrath for yourself, unto the day of wrath and of revelation by the just judgment of God</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">For he will render to each one according to his works</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">To those who, in accord with patient good works, seek glory and honor and incorruption, certainly, he will render eternal life</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">But to those who are contentious and who do not acquiesce to the truth, but instead trust in iniquity, he will render wrath and indignation</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">Tribulation and anguish are upon every soul of man that works evil: the Jew first, and also the Greek</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">But glory and honor and peace are for all who do what is good: the Jew first, and also the Greek</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">For there is no favoritism with God</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">For whoever had sinned without the law, will perish without the law. And whoever had sinned in the law, will be judged by the law</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">For it is not the hearers of the law who are just before God, but rather it is the doers of the law who shall be justified</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">For when the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature those things which are of the law, such persons, not having the law, are a law unto themselves</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">For they reveal the work of the law written in their hearts, while their conscience renders testimony about them, and their thoughts within themselves also accuse or even defend them</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">unto the day when God shall judge the hidden things of men, through Jesus Christ, according to my Gospel</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">But if you are called by name a Jew, and you rest upon the law, and you find glory in God</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">and you have known his will, and you demonstrate the more useful things, having been instructed by the law</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">you become confident within yourself that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">an instructor to the foolish, a teacher to children, because you have a type of knowledge and truth in the law</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">As a result, you teach others, but you do not teach yourself. You preach that men should not steal, but you yourself steal</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">You speak against adultery, but you commit adultery. You abominate idols, but you commit sacrilege</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">You would glory in the law, but through a betrayal of the law you dishonor God</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">(For because of you the name of God is being blasphemed among the Gentiles, just as it was written.</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">Certainly, circumcision is beneficial, if you observe the law. But if you are a betrayer of the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, if the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, shall not this lack of circumcision be counted as circumcision</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">And that which is by nature uncircumcised, if it fulfills the law, should it not judge you, who by the letter and by circumcision are a betrayer of the law</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">For a Jew is not he who seems so outwardly. Neither is circumcision that which seems so outwardly, in the flesh</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">But a Jew is he who is so inwardly. And circumcision of the heart is in the spirit, not in the letter. For its praise is not of men, but of God</li></ol>
