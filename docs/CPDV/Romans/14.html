<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">But accept those who are weak in faith, without disputing about ideas</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">For one person believes that he may eat all things, but if another is weak, let him eat plants</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">He who eats should not despise him who does not eat. And he who does not eat should not judge him who eats. For God has accepted him</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">Who are you to judge the servant of another? He stands or falls by his own Lord. But he shall stand. For God is able to make him stand</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">For one person discerns one age from the next. But another discerns unto every age. Let each one increase according to his own mind</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">He who understands the age, understands for the Lord. And he who eats, eats for the Lord; for he gives thanks to God. And he who does not eat, does not eat for the Lord, and he gives thanks to God</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">For none of us lives for himself, and none of us dies for himself</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">For if we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">For Christ died and rose again for this purpose: that he might be the ruler of both the dead and the living</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">So then, why do you judge your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">For it is written: â€œAs I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bend to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, each one of us shall offer an explanation of himself to God</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, we should no longer judge one another. Instead, judge this to a greater extent: that you should not place an obstacle before your brother, nor lead him astray</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">I know, with confidence in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in and of itself. But to him who considers anything to be unclean, it is unclean to him</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">For if your brother is grieved because of your food, you are not now walking according to love. Do not allow your food to destroy him for whom Christ died</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, what is good for us should not be a cause of blasphemy</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but rather justice and peace and joy, in the Holy Spirit</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">For he who serves Christ in this, pleases God and is proven before men</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, let us pursue the things that are of peace, and let us keep to the things that are for the edification of one another</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">Do not be willing to destroy the work of God because of food. Certainly, all things are clean. But there is harm for a man who offends by eating</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">It is good to refrain from eating meat and from drinking wine, and from anything by which your brother is offended, or led astray, or weakened</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">Do you have faith? It belongs to you, so hold it before God. Blessed is he who does not judge himself in that by which he is tested</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">But he who discerns, if he eats, is condemned, because it is not of faith. For all that is not of faith is sin</li></ol>
