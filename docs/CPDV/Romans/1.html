<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called as an Apostle, separated for the Gospel of God</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">which he had promised beforehand, through his Prophets, in the Holy Scriptures</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">about his Son, who was made for him from the offspring of David according to the flesh</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">the Son of God, who was predestined in virtue according to the Spirit of sanctification from the resurrection of the dead, our Lord Jesus Christ</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">through whom we have received grace and Apostleship, for the sake of his name, for the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">from whom you also have been called by Jesus Christ</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">To all who are at Rome, the beloved of God, called as saints. Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">Certainly, I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, first for all of you, because your faith is being announced throughout the entire world</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit by the Gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I have kept a remembrance of yo</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">always in my prayers, pleading that in some way, at some time, I may have a prosperous journey, within the will of God, to come to you</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you a certain spiritual grace to strengthen you</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">specifically, to be consoled together with you through that which is mutual: your faith and mine</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">But I want you to know, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you, (though I have been hindered even to the present time) so that I might obtain some fruit among you also, just as also among the other Gentiles</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">To the Greeks and to the uncivilized, to the wise and to the foolish, I am in debt</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">So within me there is a prompting to evangelize to you also who are at Rome</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">For I am not ashamed of the Gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation for all believers, the Jew first, and the Greek</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">For the justice of God is revealed within it, by faith unto faith, just as it was written: â€œFor the just one lives by faith.</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven over every impiety and injustice among those men who fend off the truth of God with injustice</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">For what is known about God is manifest in them. For God has manifested it to them</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">For unseen things about him have been made conspicuous, since the creation of the world, being understood by the things that were made; likewise his everlasting virtue and divinity, so much so that they have no excuse</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">For although they had known God, they did not glorify God, nor give thanks. Instead, they became weakened in their thoughts, and their foolish heart was obscured</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">For, while proclaiming themselves to be wise, they became foolish</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of flying things, and of four-legged beasts, and of serpents</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">For this reason, God handed them over to the desires of their own heart for impurity, so that they afflicted their own bodies with indignities among themselves</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they exchanged the truth of God for a lie. And they worshipped and served the creature, rather than the Creator, who is blessed for all eternity. Amen</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">Because of this, God handed them over to shameful passions. For example, their females have exchanged the natural use of the body for a use which is against nature</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">And similarly, the males also, abandoning the natural use of females, have burned in their desires for one another: males doing with males what is disgraceful, and receiving within themselves the recompense that necessarily results from their error</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">And since they did not prove to have God by knowledge, God handed them over to a morally depraved way of thinking, so that they might do those things which are not fitting</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">having been completely filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication, avarice, wickedness; full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, spite, gossiping</li><li value="30" id="30" class="svelte-2su5mk">slanderous, hateful toward God, abusive, arrogant, self-exalting, devisers of evil, disobedient to parents</li><li value="31" id="31" class="svelte-2su5mk">foolish, disorderly; without affection, without fidelity, without mercy</li><li value="32" id="32" class="svelte-2su5mk">And these, though they had known the justice of God, did not understand that those who act in such a manner are deserving of death, and not only those who do these things, but also those who consent to what is done</li></ol>
