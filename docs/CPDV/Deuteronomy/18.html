For the Lord himself is their inheritance, just as he said to them</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">This shall be the recompense for the priests from the people, and from those who offer victims, whether they will immolate an ox or a sheep. They shall give to the priest the shoulder and the breast</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">the first-fruits of grain, wine, and oil, and a portion of the wool from the shearing of the sheep</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">For the Lord your God himself has chosen him out of all your tribes, so that he may stand and minister to the name of the Lord, him and his sons, forever</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">If a Levite departs from one of the cities, throughout all of Israel, in which he lives, and if he wills and desires to go to the place which the Lord will choose</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">he shall minister in the name of the Lord his God, as do all his brothers, the Levites, who will be standing at that time in the sight of the Lord</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">He shall receive the same portion of food as the rest also receive, besides that which is due to him in his own city, by succession from his fathers</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">When you will have entered into the land which the Lord your God will give to you, be careful that you are not willing to imitate the abominations of those nations</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">Do not let there be found among you one who would purify his son or daughter by leading them through fire, nor one who consults seers, nor one who observes dreams or omens.

And I will place my words in his mouth, and he will speak to them all the things that I will instruct him</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">But against anyone who is not willing to listen to his words, which he will speak in my name, I will stand forth as the avenger</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">But if a prophet, having been corrupted by arrogance, chooses to speak, in my name, things which I did not instruct him to say, or to speak in the name of foreign gods, he shall be put to death</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">But if, in silent thought, you respond: “How will I be able to recognize a word which the Lord has not spoken?</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">you shall have this sign.
