For he has nothing else due to the siege and the destitution, with which your enemies will devastate you within all your gates</li><li value="56" id="56" class="svelte-2su5mk">The tender and pampered woman, who would not walk upon the soil, nor step firmly with her foot due to her very great softness and tenderness, will vie with her husband, who lies at her bosom, over the flesh of son and of daughter</li><li value="57" id="57" class="svelte-2su5mk">and over the filth of the afterbirth, which goes forth from between her thighs, and over the children who are born in the same hour. For they will eat them secretly, due to the scarcity of all things during the siege and the devastation, with which your enemy will oppress you within your gates</li><li value="58" id="58" class="svelte-2su5mk">If you will not keep and do all the words of this law, which have been written in this volume, and fear his glorious and terrible name, that is, the Lord your God</li><li value="59" id="59" class="svelte-2su5mk">then the Lord will increase your plagues, and the plagues of your offspring, plagues great and long-lasting, infirmities very grievous and continuous</li><li value="60" id="60" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he will turn back upon you all the afflictions of Egypt, which you fear, and these will cling to you</li><li value="61" id="61" class="svelte-2su5mk">In addition, the Lord will lead over you all the diseases and plagues that are not written in the volume of this law, until he crushes you</li><li value="62" id="62" class="svelte-2su5mk">And you will remain few in number, though you were before like the stars of heaven in multitude, because you would not listen to the voice of the Lord your God</li><li value="63" id="63" class="svelte-2su5mk">And just as before, when the Lord rejoiced over you, doing good for you and multiplying you, so shall he rejoice, scattering and overturning you, so as to take you away from the land, which you shall enter in order to possess</li><li value="64" id="64" class="svelte-2su5mk">The Lord will disperse you among all the peoples, from the heights of the earth to its furthest limits. And there you will serve foreign gods of wood and of stone, which you and your fathers did not know</li><li value="65" id="65" class="svelte-2su5mk">Similarly, you will not have tranquility, even within those nations, nor will there be any rest for the steps of your feet. For the Lord will give to you in that place a fearful heart, and failing eyes, and a life consumed with grieving</li><li value="66" id="66" class="svelte-2su5mk">And your life will be as if it were hanging before you. You will be afraid night and day, and you will not have confidence in your own life</li><li value="67" id="67" class="svelte-2su5mk">In the morning you will say, ‘Who will grant evening to me?’ and at evening, ‘Who will grant morning to me?’ because of the dread of your heart, with which you will be terrified, and because of those things that you will see with your eyes</li><li value="68" id="68" class="svelte-2su5mk">The Lord will lead you back into Egypt with a fleet of ships, along the way, about which he said to you that you would not see it again. In that place, you will be put up for sale as men and women servants to your enemies, but there will be no one willing to buy you.</li></ol>
