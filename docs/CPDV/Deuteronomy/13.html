For the Lord your God is testing you, so that it may become clear whether or not you love him with all your heart and with all your soul</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">Follow the Lord your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and listen to his voice. Him shall you serve, and to him shall you cling</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">But that prophet or forger of dreams shall be put to death. For he has spoken so as to turn you away from the Lord your God, who led you away from the land of Egypt and who redeemed you from the house of servitude, and so as to cause you to wander from the way that the Lord your God has entrusted to you. And so shall you remove the evil from your midst</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">If your brother, the son of your mother, or your own son or daughter, or your wife who is in your bosom, or your friend, whom you love like your own soul, were willing to persuade you secretly, saying: ‘Let us go, and serve foreign gods,’ which neither you nor your fathers have known</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">gods from any of the surrounding nations, whether these are near or far away, from the beginning even to the end of the earth</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">you should neither agree with him, nor listen to him.
