And bring daybreak to your victims, your tithes in three days</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And offer a sacrifice of praise with leaven. And call for voluntary oblations, and announce it. For such is your will, sons of Israel, says the Lord God</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, because of this, I have given you dull teeth in every one of your cities, and a lack of bread in all your places. And you have not been turned back towards me, says the Lord</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, I have withheld the rains from you, when there were still three months left until the harvest.

And you did not return to me, says the Lord</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">I struck you with a burning wind and with yellowing; the caterpillar  has consumed your many gardens and your vineyards, your olive groves and your fig groves.
