And seeing him, the men also crossed after him</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he divided the people and the horsemen into the midst of the foot soldiers. But the horsemen of the adversary were exceedingly numerous</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they sounded the holy trumpets. And Cendebeus and his army were turned back. And many of them fell wounded. But the rest fled into the fortress</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Judas, the brother of John, was wounded. But John pursued them, until he came to Kedron, which he had built</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they fled all the way to the towers that were in the fields of Azotus, and he burnt them with fire.

And he made them a great feast, and he hid men there</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when Simon and his sons became inebriated, Ptolemy and his men rose up, and took their weapons, and entered into the gathering. And they killed him, and his two sons, and some of his servants</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he committed a great treachery in Israel, and he repaid good with evil</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Ptolemy wrote about these things, and he sent to the king, so that he would send him an army to assist him, and he could deliver to him the region, and their cities and tributes</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he sent others to Gazara to destroy John.
