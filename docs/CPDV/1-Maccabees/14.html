And there was no one who would terrify them</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">There was nothing left of those who might fight against them in the land; kings had been crushed in those days</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he confirmed all the humble of his people, and he sought the law, and he took away every iniquity and evil</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">He glorified the sanctuary, and he multiplied the vessels of the holy places</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">And it was heard at Rome, and even in Sparta, that Jonathan had passed away.

And they have glorified their people with great glory</li><li value="30" id="30" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Jonathan gathered together his nation, and he was made their great priest, and he was laid to rest among his people</li><li value="31" id="31" class="svelte-2su5mk">And their enemies wanted to trample and lay waste to their country, and to extend their hands against their holy places</li><li value="32" id="32" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Simon resisted, and he fought for his nation, and he requested much money, and he armed the valiant men of his nation and gave them wages</li><li value="33" id="33" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he fortified the cities of Judea and Bethzur, which are along the borders of Judea, where the weaponry of the enemies was before. And he placed a garrison of Jewish men there</li><li value="34" id="34" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he fortified Joppa, which is by the sea, and Gazara, which is on the border of Azotus, where the enemies stayed before, and he placed Jews there. And he positioned with them whatever was fitting for their preparations</li><li value="35" id="35" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the people saw the acts of Simon, and the glory that he intended to bring to his nation, and they made him their commander and first priest, because he had done all these things, and because of the justice and faith that he maintained for his nation, and because he sought to exalt his people by all means</li><li value="36" id="36" class="svelte-2su5mk">And in his days, there was prosperity by his hands, so that the Gentiles were taken away from their country, and also those who were in the city of David, in Jerusalem, in the stronghold, from which they went out and contaminated all the places that were around the sanctuary, and from which they brought a great scourging against chastity</li><li value="37" id="37" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he placed in it Jewish men, as a means of protection for the region and the city, and he raised the walls of Jerusalem</li><li value="38" id="38" class="svelte-2su5mk">And king Demetrius confirmed him in the high priesthood</li><li value="39" id="39" class="svelte-2su5mk">According to these things, he made him his friend, and he glorified him with great glory</li><li value="40" id="40" class="svelte-2su5mk">For he heard that the Romans had called the Jews their friends, and associates, and brothers, and that they received the ambassadors of Simon with glory</li><li value="41" id="41" class="svelte-2su5mk">and that the Jews and their priests had consented that he should be their governor and high priest unceasingly, until there should arise a faithful prophet</li><li value="42" id="42" class="svelte-2su5mk">and that he should be the commander over them, and that he should take care of the sanctuary, and that he should appoint foremen over their works, and over the country, and over the weapons, and over the strongholds</li><li value="43" id="43" class="svelte-2su5mk">and that he should take care of the holy places, and that he should be obeyed by all, and that all the records in the country should be recorded in his name, and that he should be clothed in purple and gold</li><li value="44" id="44" class="svelte-2su5mk">and that it should not be lawful for any of the people or the priests to make void any of these things, nor to contradict things that are said by him, nor to call together an assembly in the country without him, nor to be clothed in purple, nor to use a clasp of gold</li><li value="45" id="45" class="svelte-2su5mk">And whoever will do otherwise, or who will make void any of these things, shall be guilty</li><li value="46" id="46" class="svelte-2su5mk">And it pleased all the people to appoint Simon, and to act according to these words</li><li value="47" id="47" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Simon accepted it, and he was pleased to perform the office of the high priesthood, and to be the commander and leader of the people of the Jews, and of the priests, and to be foremost over them all</li><li value="48" id="48" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they asked that this writing be placed on tablets of brass, and be placed within the precinct of the sanctuary in a celebrated place</li><li value="49" id="49" class="svelte-2su5mk">and that a copy of these be placed in the treasury, so that Simon and his sons may have it.’ </li></ol>
