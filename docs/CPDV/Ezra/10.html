And they swore it</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Ezra rose up before the house of God, and he went away to the chamber of Jehohanan, the son of Eliashib, and he entered into it. He did not eat bread, and he did not drink water. For he was mourning the transgression of those who had arrived from the captivity</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And a voice was sent into Judah and Jerusalem, to all the sons of the transmigration, so that they would gather together in Jerusalem</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">And all those who would not arrive within three days, in accord with the counsel of the leaders and the elders, would have all his substance taken away, and he would be cast out of the assembly of the  transmigration</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, all the men of Judah and of Benjamin convened in Jerusalem within three days.
