For we had said to the king: “The hand of our God is over all those who seek him in goodness. And his authority, and his strength and fury, is over all those who forsake him.</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so we fasted and begged our God for this; and as a result, we prospered</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I separated twelve from among the leaders of the priests: Sherebiah, and Hashabiah, and with them ten of their brothers</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I weighed out to them the silver and the gold, and the vessels consecrated to the house of our God, which had been offered by the king, and by his counselors and his leaders, and by all those of Israel who had been found</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I weighed out to their hands six hundred fifty talents of silver, and one hundred vessels of silver, and one hundred talents of gold</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">and twenty gold bowls which had the weight of one thousand coins, and two vessels of the finest shining brass, as beautiful as gold</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I said to them: “You are the holy ones of the Lord, and the vessels are holy, with the silver and the gold, which has been offered freely to the Lord, the God of our fathers</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">Watch and guard them, until you weigh them out before the leaders of the priests and the Levites, and the rulers of the families of Israel in Jerusalem, into the treasury of the house of the Lord.</li><li value="30" id="30" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, so that they might carry these to Jerusalem, into the house of our God</li><li value="31" id="31" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, we set out from the river Ahava, on the twelfth day of the first month, so that we might travel to Jerusalem. And the hand of our God was over us, and he freed us from the hand of the enemy and of those who lay in ambush along the way</li><li value="32" id="32" class="svelte-2su5mk">And we arrived at Jerusalem, and we stayed there for three days</li><li value="33" id="33" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then, on the fourth day, the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed out in the house of our God, by the hand of Meremoth, the son of Uriah, the priest; and with him was Eleazar, the son of Phinehas, and with them were the Levites, Jozabad, the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah, the son of Binnui</li><li value="34" id="34" class="svelte-2su5mk">This was done according to the number and weight of everything; and every weight was written down at that time</li><li value="35" id="35" class="svelte-2su5mk">Moreover, those who came from the captivity, the sons of the transmigration, offered holocausts to the God of Israel: twelve calves on behalf of all the people of Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve he-goats for sin. All these were a holocaust to the Lord</li><li value="36" id="36" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then they gave the edicts of the king to the rulers who served in the sight of the king, and to the governors beyond the river, and they exalted the people and the house of God</li></ol>
