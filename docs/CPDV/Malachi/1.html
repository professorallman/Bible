And have I not loved Jacob</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">but held hatred for Esau? And I have set his mountains in solitude, and his inheritance with the serpents of the desert</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">But if Idumea will say, “We have been destroyed, but when we return, we will build up what has been destroyed,” thus says the Lord of hosts: They will build up, and I will destroy. And they will be called “The limits of impiety,” and, “The people with whom the Lord has been angry, even to eternity.</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And your eyes will see. And you will say, “May the Lord be magnified beyond the limits of Israel.</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">The son honors the father, and the servant his master. If, therefore, I am Father, where is my honor? And if I am Master, where is my fear? says the Lord of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name.
