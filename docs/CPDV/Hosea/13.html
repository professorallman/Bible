And they have made themselves an image cast from their silver, just like the image of idols; but the whole thing has been made by craftsmen. These say to them, “Sacrifice men, you who adore calves.</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">For this reason, they will be like the morning clouds, and like the morning dew that passes away, just like the dust that is driven by a whirlwind away from the threshing floor, and like the smoke from a chimney</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">But I am the Lord your God from the land of Egypt, and you will not know God apart from me, and there is no Savior except me</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">I knew you in the desert, in the land of solitude</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">According to their pastures, they have been filled up and have been satisfied. And they have lifted up their heart, and they have forgotten me</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I will be to them like a lioness, like a leopard in the way of the Assyrians</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">I will run to meet them like a bear that has been robbed of her young, and I will split open the middle of their liver.

Your help is only in me</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">Where is your king? Now, especially, let him save you in all your cities, and from your judges, about whom you said, “Give me kings and princes.</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">I will give you a king in my wrath, and I will take him away in my indignation</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">The iniquity of Ephraim has been bound; his sin has been engulfed</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">The pains of giving birth will reach him.
