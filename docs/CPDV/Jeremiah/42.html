And pray for us to the Lord your God, on behalf of this entire remnant. For few out of many have been left behind, just as your eyes behold us</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, may the Lord your God announce to us the way that we must travel, and the word that we must accomplish.</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Jeremiah, the prophet, said to them: “I have listened. Behold, I will pray to the Lord your God according to your words. And whatever word he will respond to me, I will declare to you. And I will conceal nothing from you.</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they said to Jeremiah: “May the Lord be the witness between us of truth and fidelity, if we do not act according to whatever word the Lord your God will send by you to us</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">Whether it is for good or for harm, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God, to whom we are sending you.

None of them will remain, nor will they escape from the face of the evil that I will bring over them</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Just as my fury and my indignation has been enflamed over the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so will my indignation be enflamed over you, when you will have entered into Egypt. And so you will be an oath, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a disgrace. And you will never see this place again</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">This is the word of the Lord concerning you, O remnant of Judah: Do not choose to enter into Egypt, for certainly you understand what I have sworn to you this day</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">For you have deceived your own souls.
