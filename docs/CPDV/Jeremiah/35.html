<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, saying</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">“Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and lead them into the house of the Lord, into one of the halls of the treasuries. And you shall give them wine to drink.</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so I took Jaazaniah, the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the entire house of the Rechabites</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">and I led them into the house of the Lord, to the treasury of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was near the treasury of the princes, above the storehouse of Maaseiah, the son of Shallum, who was the guardian of the entrance</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I placed before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls filled with wine, and chalices. And I said to them, “Drink wine.</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they responded: “We will not drink wine. For Jonadab, the son of Rechab, our father, instructed us, saying: ‘You shall not drink wine, you and your sons, in perpetuity</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And you shall not build houses, and you shall not sow any seeds, and you shall not plant or have vineyards. Instead, you shall live in tents all your days, so that you may live many days upon the face of the earth, in which you are sojourners.</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he has commanded us, so that we do not drink wine all our days, we and our wives, our sons and daughters</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">And we do not build houses in which to live. And we do not have vineyard, or field, or seed to sow</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">Instead, we live in tents, and we have been obedient in accord with all that Jonadab, our father, has instructed us</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">But when Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had ascended to our land, we said: ‘Come and let us enter into Jerusalem, before the face of the army of the Chaldeans, and before the face of the army of Syria.’ And we have remained in Jerusalem.</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">“Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Go, and say to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Will you not accept discipline, so that you obey my words, says the Lord</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">The words of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, in which he instructed his sons, so that they would not drink wine, have prevailed. And they have not drunk wine, even to this day. For they have obeyed the instruction of their father. But I have spoken to you, rising and speaking from early morning, and you did not obey me</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I have sent to you all my servants, the prophets, rising at first light, and sending, and saying: ‘Convert, each one from his wicked way, and make your intentions good. And do not choose to follow strange gods, nor shall you worship them. And then you shall live in the land which I gave to you and to your fathers.’ And yet you have not inclined your ear, and you have not heeded me</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">So the sons of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, have remained firm in the commandment of their father, which he instructed to them, while this people has not been obedient to me</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">For this reason, thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will lead over Judah and over all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every evil that I have declared against them. For I have spoken to them, and they have not listened. I have called to them, and they have not responded to me.</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites: “Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab, your father, and have kept all his precepts, and have done all that he has instructed you</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">because of this, thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: There will not be a man lacking from the stock of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, standing in my sight, for all days.</li></ol>
