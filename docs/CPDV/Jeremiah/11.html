At the voice of a word, a great fire was kindled in it, and its greenery was burned up</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the Lord of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced an evil against you, concerning the evils of the house of Israel and the house of Judah, which they have done to themselves so as to provoke me, by offering libations to Baal.</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">But you, O Lord, have revealed this to me, and I have understood. Then you displayed their efforts to me</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I was like a meek lamb, who is being carried to be a victim. And I did not realize that they had devised plans against me, saying: “Let us place wood upon his bread, and let us eradicate him from the land of the living, and let his name no longer be remembered.</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">But you, O Lord of hosts, who judges justly, and who tests the temperament and the heart, let me see your vengeance against them.
