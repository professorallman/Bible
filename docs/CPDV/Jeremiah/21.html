And I will gather these things together in the midst of this city</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I myself will make war against you: with an outstretched hand, and with a strong arm, and in fury, and in indignation, and in great wrath</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I will strike the inhabitants of this city; men and beasts will die from a great pestilence</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And afterward, thus says the Lord: I will give Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and his servants, and his people, and those who have been left behind in this city after pestilence and the sword and famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their lives.
