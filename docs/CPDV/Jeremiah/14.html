And the outcry of Jerusalem has ascended</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">The greater ones have sent their lesser ones to the water. They went to draw water; they did not find water; they carried their vessels back empty. They were confounded and afflicted, and so they covered their heads</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">Because of the devastation of the earth, because rain did not fall upon the earth, the farmers were confounded; they covered their heads</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">For even the doe has given birth in the field, and then left it behind. For there was no grass</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the wild donkeys stood upon the rocks; like dragons, they drew in the wind, but their eyes failed. For there was no grass.</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">“O Lord, if our iniquities have responded against us, let it be for the sake of your name. For our rebellions are many; we have sinned against you</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">O Hope of Israel, its Savior in time of tribulation, why would you be like a sojourner in the land, and like a traveler turning aside for lodging</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">Why would you be like a wandering man, like a strong man who is unable to save? But you, O Lord, are with us, and your name is invoked over us, so do not abandon us!</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">Thus says the Lord to this people, who have loved to move their feet, and who have not rested, but who have not pleased the Lord: “Now he will remember their iniquities, and now he will visit against their sins.</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the Lord said to me: “Do not choose to pray for this people for good</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">When they will fast, I will not heed their petitions.

For the virgin daughter of my people has been crushed by a great affliction, by a very grievous wound.</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">“If I go out into the fields: behold, those slain by the sword. And if I enter into the city: behold, those weakened by famine. Likewise, the prophet, too, and the priest, have gone into a land that they did not know</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">Could you have utterly cast out Judah? Or has your soul abhorred Zion? Then why have you struck us, so much so that there is no health for us?
