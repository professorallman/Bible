For Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, appointed him as king in the land of Judah</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">And neither he himself, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, obeyed the words of the Lord, which he spoke by the hand of Jeremiah, the prophet</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">And king Zedekiah sent Jehucal, the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying: “Pray to the Lord our God for us.</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now Jeremiah was walking freely in the midst of the people. For they had not yet sent him into the custody of the prison. And then the army of Pharaoh went forth from Egypt. And hearing this, the Chaldeans, who were besieging Jerusalem, withdrew from Jerusalem</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">“Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: So shall you say to the king of Judah, who sent you to question me: Behold, the army of Pharaoh, which has gone forth in assistance to you, will return to their own land, into Egypt</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the Chaldeans will return and will make war against this city. And they will seize it and burn it with fire</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">Thus says the Lord: Do not be willing to deceive your own souls, saying: ‘The Chaldeans will certainly withdraw and go away from us.’ For they will not go away</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">But even if you were to strike down the entire army of the Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and if there were left behind from among them only a few wounded men, they would rise up, each one from his tent, and they would burn this city with fire.</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, when the army of the Chaldeans had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">Jeremiah went forth from Jerusalem, to go into the land of Benjamin, and to distribute a possession there, in the sight of the citizens</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when he had arrived at the gate of Benjamin, the keeper of the gate, whose turn it was to be there, was named Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah. And he apprehended Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are fleeing to the Chaldeans.</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Jeremiah responded: “That is false. I am not fleeing to the Chaldeans.” But he did not listen to him. And so Irijah took Jeremiah, and he brought him to the leaders</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, the leaders were angry with Jeremiah, and so they beat him and sent him to the prison that was in the house of Jonathan, the scribe.

Let my petition prevail in your sight. And do not send me back into the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then king Zedekiah instructed that Jeremiah be confined to the vestibule of the prison, and that they should give him a twist of bread daily, along with stew, until all the bread in the city had been consumed.
