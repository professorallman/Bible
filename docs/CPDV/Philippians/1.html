As long as, by every means, whether under pretext or in truthfulness, Christ is announced. And about this, I rejoice, and moreover, I will continue to rejoice</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">For I know that this will bring me to salvation, through your prayers and under the ministration of the Spirit of Jesus Christ</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">by means of my own expectation and hope.

But I do not know which I would choose</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">For I am constrained between the two: having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, which is the far better thing</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">but then to remain in the flesh is necessary for your sake</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">And having this confidence, I know that I shall remain and that I shall continue to remain with all of you, for your advancement and for your joy in the faith</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">so that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me, through my return to you again</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">Only let your behavior be worthy of the Gospel of Christ, so that, whether I return and see you, or whether, being absent, I hear about you, still you may stand firm with one spirit, with one mind, laboring together for the faith of the Gospel</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">And in nothing be terrified by the adversaries.
