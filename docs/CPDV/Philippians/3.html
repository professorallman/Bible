It is certainly not tiresome for me to write the same things to you, but for you, it is not necessary</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">Beware of dogs; beware of those who work evil; beware of those who are divisive</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">For we are the circumcised, we who serve God in the Spirit and who glory in Christ Jesus, having no confidence in the flesh</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">Nevertheless, I might have confidence also in the flesh, for if anyone else seems to have confidence in the flesh, more so do I</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">For I was circumcised on the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, from the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew among Hebrews. According to the law, I was a Pharisee</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">according to zeal, I persecuted the Church of God; according to the justice that is in the law, I lived without blame</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the things which had been to my gain, the same have I considered a loss, for the sake of Christ</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">Yet truly, I consider everything to be a loss, because of the preeminent knowledge of Jesus Christ, my Lord, for whose sake I have suffered the loss of everything, considering it all to be like dung, so that I may gain Christ</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">and so that you may be found in him, not having my justice, which is of the law, but that which is of the faith of Christ Jesus, the justice within faith, which is of God</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">So shall I know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his Passion, having been fashioned according to his death</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">if, by some means, I might attain to the resurrection which is from the dead</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">It is not as though I have already received this, or were already perfect. But rather I pursue, so that by some means I might attain, that in which I have already been attained by Christ Jesus</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">Brothers, I do not consider that I have already attained this. Instead, I do one thing: forgetting those things that are behind, and extending myself toward those things that are ahead</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">I pursue the destination, the prize of the heavenly calling of God in Christ Jesus</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, as many of us as are being perfected, let us agree about this. And if in anything you disagree, God will reveal this to you also</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">Yet truly, whatever point we reach, let us be of the same mind, and let us remain in the same rule</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">Be imitators of me, brothers, and observe those who are walking similarly, just as you have seen by our example</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">For many persons, about whom I have often told you (and now tell you, weeping,) are walking as enemies of the cross of Christ</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">Their end is destruction; their god is their belly; and their glory is in their shame: for they are immersed in earthly things</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">But our way of life is in heaven. And from heaven, too, we await the Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">who will transform the body of our lowliness, according to the form of the body of his glory, by means of that power by which he is even able to subject all things to himself</li></ol>
