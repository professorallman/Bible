For if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">But this is just as it has been written: â€œThe eye has not seen, and the ear has not heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man, what things God has prepared for those who love him.</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">But God has revealed these things to us through his Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">And who can know the things that are of a man, except the spirit which is within that man? So also, no one knows the things which are of God, except the Spirit of God</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">But we have not received the spirit of this world, but the Spirit who is of God, so that we may understand the things that have been given to us by God</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">And we are also speaking of these things, not in the learned words of human wisdom, but in the doctrine of the Spirit, bringing spiritual things together with spiritual things</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the animal nature of man does not perceive these things that are of the Spirit of God. For it is foolishness to him, and he is not able to understand it, because it must be examined spiritually</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the spiritual nature of man judges all things, and he himself may be judged by no man</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">For who has known the mind of the Lord, so that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ</li></ol>
