And if anyone would borrow from you, do not turn away from him</li><li value="43" id="43" class="svelte-2su5mk">You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor, and you shall have hatred for your enemy.</li><li value="44" id="44" class="svelte-2su5mk">But I say to you: Love your enemies. Do good to those who hate you. And pray for those who persecute and slander you</li><li value="45" id="45" class="svelte-2su5mk">In this way, you shall be sons of your Father, who is in heaven. He causes his sun to rise upon the good and the bad, and he causes it to rain upon the just and the unjust</li><li value="46" id="46" class="svelte-2su5mk">For if you love those who love you, what reward will you have? Do not even tax collectors behave this way</li><li value="47" id="47" class="svelte-2su5mk">And if you greet only your brothers, what more have you done? Do not even the pagans behave this way</li><li value="48" id="48" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, be perfect, even as your heavenly Father is perfect.</li></ol>
