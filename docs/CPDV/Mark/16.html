For certainly it was very large</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And upon entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, covered with a white robe, and they were astonished</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he said to them, “Do not become frightened. You are seeking Jesus of Nazareth, the Crucified One. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you into Galilee. There you shall see him, just as he told you.</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">But they, going out, fled from the tomb. For trembling and fear had overwhelmed them.
