<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the Pharisees and some of the scribes, arriving from Jerusalem, gathered together before him</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when they had seen certain ones from his disciples eating bread with common hands, that is, with unwashed hands, they disparaged them</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not eat without repeatedly washing their hands, holding to the tradition of the elders</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when returning from the market, unless they wash, they do not eat. And there are many other things which have been handed down to them to observe: the washings of cups, and pitchers, and bronze containers, and beds</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so the Pharisees and the scribes questioned him: “Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but they eat bread with common hands?</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">But in response, he said to them: “So well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites, just as it has been written: ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And in vain do they worship me, teaching the doctrines and precepts of men.</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">For abandoning the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men, to the washing of pitchers and cups. And you do many other things similar to these.</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he said to them: “You effectively nullify the precept of God, so that you may observe your own tradition</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">For Moses said: ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘Whoever will have cursed father or mother, let him die a death.</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">But you say, ‘If a man will have said to his father or mother: Korban, (which is a gift) whatever is from me will be to your benefit,</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">then you do not release him to do anything for his father or mother</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">rescinding the word of God through your tradition, which you have handed down. And you do many other similar things in this way.</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">And again, calling the crowd to him, he said to them: “Listen to me, all of you, and understand</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">There is nothing from outside a man which, by entering into him, is able to defile him. But the things which proceed from a man, these are what pollute a man</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when he had entered into the house, away from the crowd, his disciples questioned him about the parable</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he said to them: “So, are you also without prudence? Do you not understand that everything entering to a man from outside is not able to pollute him</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">For it does not enter into his heart, but into the gut, and it exits into the sewer, purging all foods.</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">“But,” he said “the things which go out from a man, these pollute a man</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">For from within, from the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">thefts, avarice, wickedness, deceitfulness, homosexuality, an evil eye, blasphemy, self-exaltation, foolishness</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">All these evils proceed from within and pollute a man.</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">And rising up, he went from there to the area of Tyre and Sidon. And entering into a house, he intended no one to know about it, but he was not able to remain hidden</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">For a woman whose daughter had an unclean spirit, as soon as she heard about him, entered and fell prostrate at his feet</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">For the woman was a Gentile, by birth a Syro-Phoenician. And she petitioned him, so that he would cast the demon from her daughter</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he said to her: “First allow the sons to have their fill. For it is not good to take away the bread of the sons and throw it to the dogs.</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">But she responded by saying to him: “Certainly, Lord. Yet the young dogs also eat, under the table, from the crumbs of the children.</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he said to her, “Because of this saying, go; the demon has gone out of your daughter.</li><li value="30" id="30" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when she had gone to her house, she found the girl lying on the bed; and the demon had gone away</li><li value="31" id="31" class="svelte-2su5mk">And again, departing from the borders of Tyre, he went by way of Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the area of the Ten Cities</li><li value="32" id="32" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they brought someone who was deaf and mute to him. And they begged him, so that he would lay his hand upon him</li><li value="33" id="33" class="svelte-2su5mk">And taking him away from the crowd, he put his fingers into his ears; and spitting, he touched his tongue</li><li value="34" id="34" class="svelte-2su5mk">And gazing up to heaven, he groaned and said to him: “Ephphatha,” which is, “Be opened.</li><li value="35" id="35" class="svelte-2su5mk">And immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke correctly</li><li value="36" id="36" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he instructed them not to tell anyone. But as much as he instructed them, so much more did they preach about it</li><li value="37" id="37" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so much more did they wonder, saying: “He has done all things well. He has caused both the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.</li></ol>
