The Lord is avenging with his enemies, and he becomes angry with his adversaries</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">The Lord is patient and great in strength, and those who are not clean, he makes innocent. The Lord is in a tempest, and his way is a whirlwind, and the clouds are dust at his feet</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">He is the one who rebukes the sea, and who dries it up, and who leads all the rivers to the desert.
