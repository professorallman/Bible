Many will pass through, and knowledge will be increased.</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I, Daniel, looked, and behold, similarly two others stood up, one over here, on the bank of the river, and the other over there, on the other bank of the river</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I said to the man, who was clothed in linen, who stood over the waters of the river, “How long will it be until the end of these wonders?</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I heard the man, who was clothed in linen, who stood over the waters of the river, when he had lifted his right hand and his left hand up to heaven, and had sworn by He who lives forever, that it would be for a time, and times, and half a time. And when the dispersion of the hand of the holy people is completed, all these things will be completed</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I heard and did not understand.
