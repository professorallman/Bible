And so they stood before the statue that king Nebuchadnezzar had set up</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">And a herald proclaimed loudly, “To you it is said, to you peoples, tribes, and languages</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">that in the hour when you will hear the sound of the trumpet and the pipe and the lute, the harp and the psaltery, and of the symphony and every kind of music, you must fall down and adore the gold statue, which king Nebuchadnezzar has set up</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">But if anyone will not bow down and adore, in the same hour he will be cast into a furnace of burning fire.</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">After this, therefore, as soon as all the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the pipe and the lute, the harp and the psaltery, and of the symphony and every kind of music, all the peoples, tribes, and languages fell down and adored the gold statue, which king Nebuchadnezzar had set up</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">And soon, about the same time, some influential Chaldeans came and accused the Jews</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">and they said to king Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, live forever</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">You, O king, have established a decree, so that every man who might hear the sound of the trumpet, the pipe and the lute, the harp and the psaltery, and of the symphony and every kind of music, will prostrate himself and adore the gold statue</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">But if any man will not fall down and adore, he would be cast into a furnace of burning fire</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">Yet there are influential Jews, whom you have appointed over the works of the region of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, have scorned your decree. They do not worship your gods, and they do not adore the gold statue which you have raised up.</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Nebuchadnezzar, in fury and in wrath, commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego should be brought, and so, without delay, they were brought before the king</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">And king Nebuchadnezzar addressed them and said, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not worship my gods, nor adore the gold statue, which I have set up</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, if you are prepared now, whenever you hear the sound of the trumpet, pipe, lute, harp and psaltery, and of the symphony and every kind of music, prostrate yourselves and adore the statue which I have made.

And who is the God that will rescue you from my hand?</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to king Nebuchadnezzar, “It is not right for us to obey you in this matter</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">For behold our God, whom we worship, is able to rescue us from the oven of burning fire and to free us from your hands, O king</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">But even if he will not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not worship your gods, nor adore the gold statue, which you have raised up.</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury and the appearance of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and he commanded that the furnace should be heated to seven times its usual fire</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he ordered the strongest men of his army to bind the feet of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the furnace of burning fire</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">And immediately these men were bound, and along with their coats, and their hats, and their shoes, and their garments, were cast into the middle of the furnace of burning fire</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the king’s order was so urgent that the furnace was heated excessively. As a result, those men who had cast in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, were killed by the flame of the fire</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">But these three men, that is, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, having been bound, fell down in the middle of the oven of burning fire</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they were walking in the midst of the flame, praising God and blessing the Lord</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Azariah, while standing, prayed in this manner, and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire, he said</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">“Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers, and your name is praiseworthy and glorious for all ages</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">For you are just in all the things that you have accomplished for us, and all your works are true, and your ways are right, and all your judgments are true</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">For you have made equally true judgments in all the things that you have brought upon us and upon Jerusalem, the holy city of our fathers. For in truth and in judgment, you have brought down all these things because of our sins</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">For we have sinned, and we have committed iniquity in withdrawing from you, and we have offended in all things</li><li value="30" id="30" class="svelte-2su5mk">And we have not listened to your precepts, nor have we observed or done as you have ordered us, so that it might go well with us</li><li value="31" id="31" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, everything that you have brought upon us, and all that you have done for us, you have done in true judgment</li><li value="32" id="32" class="svelte-2su5mk">And you have delivered us into the hands of our enemies:  traitors, unjust and most wicked, and to a king, unjust and most wicked, even more so than all others on earth</li><li value="33" id="33" class="svelte-2su5mk">And now we are not able to open our mouths. We have become a shame and a disgrace to your servants and to those who worship you</li><li value="34" id="34" class="svelte-2su5mk">Do not hand us over forever, we ask you, because of your name, and do not abolish your covenant</li><li value="35" id="35" class="svelte-2su5mk">And do not withdraw your mercy from us, because of Abraham, your beloved, and Isaac, your servant, and Israel, your holy one</li><li value="36" id="36" class="svelte-2su5mk">You have spoken with them, promising that you would multiply their offspring like the stars of heaven and like the sand on the seashore</li><li value="37" id="37" class="svelte-2su5mk">For we, O Lord, are diminished more than all other peoples, and we are brought low throughout all the earth, this day, because of our sins</li><li value="38" id="38" class="svelte-2su5mk">Neither is there, at this time, a leader, or a ruler, or a prophet, nor any holocaust, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place of first fruits, in your eyes</li><li value="39" id="39" class="svelte-2su5mk">so that we may be able to find your mercy. Nevertheless, with a contrite soul and humble spirit, let us be accepted</li><li value="40" id="40" class="svelte-2su5mk">Just as in the holocausts of rams and bullocks, and as in thousands of fat lambs, so let our sacrifice be in your sight this day, in order to please you. For there is no shame for those who trust in you</li><li value="41" id="41" class="svelte-2su5mk">And now we follow you wholeheartedly, and we fear you, and we seek your face</li><li value="42" id="42" class="svelte-2su5mk">Do not put us to shame, but deal with us in agreement with your clemency and according to the multitude of your mercies</li><li value="43" id="43" class="svelte-2su5mk">And rescue us by your wonders and give glory to your name, O Lord</li><li value="44" id="44" class="svelte-2su5mk">And let all those be confounded who lead your servants towards evil. May they be confounded by all your power and may their strength be crushed</li><li value="45" id="45" class="svelte-2su5mk">And may they know that you are the Lord, the only God, and glorious above the world.</li><li value="46" id="46" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they did not cease, those attendants of the king who had cast them in, to heat the furnace with oil, and flax, and pitch, and brush</li><li value="47" id="47" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the flame streamed forth above the furnace for forty-nine cubits</li><li value="48" id="48" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the fire erupted and burnt those of the Chaldeans within its reach near the furnace</li><li value="49" id="49" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the angel of the Lord descended with Azariah and his companions into the furnace; and he cast the flame of the fire out of the furnace</li><li value="50" id="50" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he made the middle of the furnace like the blowing of a damp wind, and the fire did not touch them, nor afflict them, nor bother them at all</li><li value="51" id="51" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then these three, as if with one voice, praised and glorified and blessed God, in the furnace, saying</li><li value="52" id="52" class="svelte-2su5mk">“Blessed are you, Lord, God of our fathers:  praiseworthy, and glorious, and exalted above all forever.
