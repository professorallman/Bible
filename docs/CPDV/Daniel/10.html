Then, opening my mouth, I spoke and said to him who stood before me, “My lord, at the sight of you, my limbs became weak and no strength has remained in me</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, how can the servant of my lord speak with my lord? For no strength remains in me; and even my breathing is hindered.</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, he who looked like a man, touched me again and strengthened me</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he said, “Fear not, O man of longing. May peace be with you. Take courage and be strong.” And when he spoke to me, I recovered, and I said, “Speak, my lord, for you have strengthened me.</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he said, “Do you not know why I have come to you?
