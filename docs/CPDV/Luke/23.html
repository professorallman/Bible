<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the entire multitude of them, rising up, led him to Pilate</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then they began to accuse him, saying, “We found this one subverting our nation, and prohibiting giving tribute to Caesar, and saying that he is Christ the king.</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Pilate questioned him, saying: “You are the king of the Jews?” But in response, he said: “You are saying it.</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Pilate said to the leaders of the priests and to the crowds, “I find no case against this man.</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">But they continued more intensely, saying: “He has stirred up the people, teaching throughout all of Judea, beginning from Galilee, even to this place.</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">But Pilate, upon hearing Galilee, asked if the man were of Galilee</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when he realized that he was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him away to Herod, who was himself also at Jerusalem in those days</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Herod, upon seeing Jesus, was very glad. For he had been wanting to see him for a long time, because he had heard so many things about him, and he was hoping to see some kind of sign wrought by him</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then he questioned him with many words. But he gave him no response at all</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the leaders of the priests, and the scribes, stood firm in persistently accusing him</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Herod, with his soldiers, scorned him. And he ridiculed him, clothing him in a white garment. And he sent him back to Pilate</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Herod and Pilate became friends on that day. For previously they were enemies to one another</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Pilate, calling together the leaders of the priests, and the magistrates, and the people</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">said to them: “You have brought before me this man, as one who disturbs the people. And behold, having questioned him before you, I find no case against this man, in those things about which you accuse him</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">And neither did Herod. For I sent you all to him, and behold, nothing deserving of death was recorded about him</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, I will chastise him and release him.</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now he was required to release one person for them on the feast day</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the entire crowd exclaimed together, saying: “Take this one, and release to us Barabbas!</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now he had been cast into prison because of a certain sedition that occurred in the city and for murder</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">But they shouted in response, saying: “Crucify him! Crucify him!</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then he said to them a third time: “Why? What evil has he done? I find no case against him for death. Therefore, I will chastise him and release him.</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">But they persisted, with loud voices, in demanding that he be crucified. And their voices increased in intensity</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so Pilate issued a judgment granting their petition</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then he released for them the one who had been cast into prison for murder and sedition, whom they were requesting. Yet truly, Jesus he handed over to their will</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">And as they were leading him away, they apprehended a certain one, Simon of Cyrene, as he was returning from the countryside. And they imposed the cross on him to carry after Jesus</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then a great crowd of people followed him, with women who were mourning and lamenting him</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">But Jesus, turning to them, said: “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep over me. Instead, weep over yourselves and over your children</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">For behold, the days will arrive in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have not borne, and the breasts that have not nursed.</li><li value="30" id="30" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall over us,’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us.</li><li value="31" id="31" class="svelte-2su5mk">For if they do these things with green wood, what will be done with the dry?</li><li value="32" id="32" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now they also led out two other criminals with him, in order to execute them</li><li value="33" id="33" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when they arrived at the place that is called Calvary, they crucified him there, with the robbers, one to the right and the other to the left</li><li value="34" id="34" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them. For they know not what they do.” And truly, dividing his garments, they cast lots</li><li value="35" id="35" class="svelte-2su5mk">And people were standing near, watching. And the leaders among them derided him, saying: “He saved others. Let him save himself, if this one is the Christ, the elect of God.</li><li value="36" id="36" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the soldiers also ridiculed him, approaching him and offering him vinegar</li><li value="37" id="37" class="svelte-2su5mk">and saying, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.</li><li value="38" id="38" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now there was also an inscription written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS</li><li value="39" id="39" class="svelte-2su5mk">And one of those robbers who were hanging blasphemed him, saying, “If you are the Christ, save yourself and us.</li><li value="40" id="40" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the other responded by rebuking him, saying: “Do you have no fear of God, since you are under the same condemnation</li><li value="41" id="41" class="svelte-2su5mk">And indeed, it is just for us. For we are receiving what our deeds deserve. But truly, this one has done nothing wrong.</li><li value="42" id="42" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom.</li><li value="43" id="43" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Jesus said to him, “Amen I say to you, this day you shall be with me in Paradise.</li><li value="44" id="44" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now it was nearly the sixth hour, and a darkness occurred over the entire earth, until the ninth hour</li><li value="45" id="45" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the sun was obscured. And the veil of the temple was torn down the middle</li><li value="46" id="46" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said: “Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.” And upon saying this, he expired</li><li value="47" id="47" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now, the centurion, seeing what had happened, glorified God, saying, “Truly, this man was the Just One.</li><li value="48" id="48" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the entire crowd of those who came together to see this spectacle also saw what had happened, and they returned, striking their breasts</li><li value="49" id="49" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now all those who knew him, and the women who had followed him from Galilee, were standing at a distance, watching these things</li><li value="50" id="50" class="svelte-2su5mk">And behold, there was a man named Joseph, who was a councilman, a good and just man</li><li value="51" id="51" class="svelte-2su5mk">(for he had not consented to their decision or their actions). He was from Arimathea, a city of Judea. And he was himself also anticipating the kingdom of God</li><li value="52" id="52" class="svelte-2su5mk">This man approached Pilate and petitioned for the body of Jesus</li><li value="53" id="53" class="svelte-2su5mk">And taking him down, he wrapped him in a fine linen cloth, and he placed him in a tomb hewn from rock, in which no one had ever been placed</li><li value="54" id="54" class="svelte-2su5mk">And it was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near</li><li value="55" id="55" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now the women who had come with him from Galilee, by following, saw the tomb and the manner in which his body was placed</li><li value="56" id="56" class="svelte-2su5mk">And upon returning, they prepared aromatic spices and ointments. But on the Sabbath, indeed, they rested, according to the commandment</li></ol>
