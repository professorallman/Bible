<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now tax collectors and sinners were drawing near to him, so that they might listen to him</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, “This one accepts sinners and eats with them.</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he told this parable to them, saying</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">“What man among you, who has one hundred sheep, and if he will have lost one of them, would not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after the one whom he had lost, until he finds it</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when he has found it, he places it on his shoulders, rejoicing</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And returning home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them: ‘Congratulate me! For I have found my sheep, which had been lost.</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">I say to you, that there will be so much more joy in heaven over one sinner repenting, than over the ninety-nine just, who do not need to repent</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">Or what woman, having ten drachmas, if she will have lost one drachma, would not light a candle, and sweep the house, and diligently search until she finds it</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying: ‘Rejoice with me! For I have found the drachma, which I had lost.</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">So I say to you, there will be joy before the Angels of God over even one sinner who is repentant.</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he said: “A certain man had two sons</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the younger of them said to the father, ‘Father, give me the portion of your estate which would go to me.’ And he divided the estate between them</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">And after not many days, the younger son, gathering it all together, set out on a long journey to a distant region. And there, he dissipated his substance, living in luxury</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">And after he had consumed it all, a great famine occurred in that region, and he began to be in need</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that region. And he sent him to his farm, in order to feed the swine</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he wanted to fill his belly with the scraps that the swine ate. But no one would give it to him</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">And returning to his senses, he said: ‘How many hired hands in my father’s house have abundant bread, while I perish here in famine</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">I shall rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">I am not worthy to be called your son. Make me one of your hired hands.</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">And rising up, he went to his father. But while he was still at a distance, his father saw him, and he was moved with compassion, and running to him, he fell upon his neck and kissed him</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the son said to him: ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. Now I am not worthy to be called your son.</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the father said to his servants: ‘Quickly! Bring out the best robe, and clothe him with it. And put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">And bring the fatted calf here, and kill it. And let us eat and hold a feast</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">For this son of mine was dead, and has revived; he was lost, and is found.’ And they began to feast</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">But his elder son was in the field. And when he returned and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he called one of the servants, and he questioned him as to what these things meant</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he said to him: ‘Your brother has returned, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safely.</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then he became indignant, and he was unwilling to enter. Therefore, his father, going out, began to plead with him</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">And in response, he said to his father: ‘Behold, I have been serving you for so many years. And I have never transgressed your commandment. And yet, you have never given me even a young goat, so that I might feast with my friends</li><li value="30" id="30" class="svelte-2su5mk">Yet after this son of yours returned, who has devoured his substance with loose women, you have killed the fatted calf for him.</li><li value="31" id="31" class="svelte-2su5mk">But he said to him: ‘Son, you are with me always, and all that I have is yours</li><li value="32" id="32" class="svelte-2su5mk">But it was necessary to feast and to rejoice. For this brother of yours was dead, and has revived; he was lost, and is found.’ </li></ol>
