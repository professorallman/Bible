But the mere hearing of the word did not benefit them, since it was not joined together with a faith in those things that they heard</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">For we who have believed shall enter into rest, in the same manner as he said: “So it is as I have sworn in my wrath: They shall not enter into my rest!” And certainly, this is when the works from the foundation of the world have been finished</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">For, in a certain place, he spoke about the seventh day in this manner: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And in this place again: “They shall not enter into my rest!</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, this is because certain ones remain who are to enter into it, and those to whom it was announced first did not enter into it, because of unbelief</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">Again, he defines a certain day, after so much time, saying in David, “Today,” just as it was stated above, “If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">For if Jesus had offered them rest, he would never have spoken, afterward, about another day</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, there remains a Sabbath of rest for the people of God</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">For whoever has entered into his rest, the same has also rested from his works, just as God did from his</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, let us hasten to enter into that rest, so that no one may fall into the same example of unbelief</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">For the Word of God is living and effective: more piercing than any two-edged sword, reaching to the division even between the soul and the spirit, even between the joints and the marrow, and so it discerns the thoughts and intentions of the heart</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">And there is no created thing that is invisible to his sight.
