We are that house, if we firmly retain the faithfulness and the glory of hope, even unto the end</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">Because of this, it is just as the Holy Spirit says: “If today you hear his voice</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, the very day of temptation, in the desert</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">where your fathers tested me, even though they had seen and examined my works for forty years</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">For this reason, I was enraged against this generation, and I said: They always wander astray in heart. For they have not known my ways</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">So it is as I swore in my wrath: They shall not enter into my rest!</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">Be cautious, brothers, lest perhaps there may be, in any of you, an evil heart of unbelief, turning aside from the living God</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">Instead, exhort one another every day, while it is still called ‘today,’ so that none of you may become hardened through the falseness of sin</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">For we have been made participants in Christ. This is only so, if we firmly retain the beginning of his substance, even unto the end</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">For it has been said: “If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts, in the same manner as in the former provocation.</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">For some of those listening did provoke him. But not all of these had set forth from Egypt through Moses</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">So against whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not those who had sinned, whose dead bodies lay prostrate in the desert</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">But to whom did he swear that they would not enter into his rest, except to those who were incredulous</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, we perceive that they were not able to enter because of unbelief</li></ol>
