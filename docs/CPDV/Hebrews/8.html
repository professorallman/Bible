<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now the main point in the things that have been stated is this: that we have so great a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of Majesty in the heavens</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">who is the minister of holy things, and of the true tabernacle, which was established by the Lord, not by man</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. Therefore, it is necessary for him also to have something to offer</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, if he were upon the earth, he would not be a priest, since there would be others to offer gifts according to the law</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">gifts which serve as mere examples and shadows of the heavenly things. And so it was answered to Moses, when he was about to complete the tabernacle: “See to it,” he said, “that you make everything according to the example which was revealed to you on the mountain.</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">But now he has been granted a better ministry, so much so that he is also the Mediator of a better testament, which has been confirmed by better promises</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">For if the former one had been entirely without fault, then a place certainly would not have been sought for a subsequent one</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">For, finding fault with them, he says: “Behold, the days shall arrive, says the Lord, when I will consummate a New Testament over the house of Israel and the house of Judah</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">not according to the testament which I made with their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand, so that I might lead them away from the land of Egypt. For they did not remain in my testament, and so I disregarded them, says the Lord</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">For this is the testament which I will set before the house of Israel, after those days, says the Lord. I will instill my laws in their minds, and I will inscribe my laws on their hearts. And so, I will be their God, and they shall be my people</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they will not teach, each one his neighbor, and each one his brother, saying: ‘Know the Lord.’ For all shall know me, from the least, even to the greatest of them</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">For I will forgive their iniquities, and I will no longer remember their sins.</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now in saying something new, he has made the former old. But that which decays and grows old is close to passing away</li></ol>
