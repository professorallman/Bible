For the Lord is with you.</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">But it happened in that night, behold, the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">“Go, and say to my servant David: ‘Thus says the Lord: Should you build a house for me as a dwelling place</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">For I have not lived in a house from the day that I led the sons of Israel away from the land of Egypt, even to this day. Instead, I have walked in a tabernacle, and in a tent</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And in all the places that I have crossed through, with all the sons of Israel, did I ever speak a word to anyone from the tribes of Israel, whom I instructed to pasture my people Israel, saying: Why have you not built me a house of cedar?</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">And now, so shall you speak to my servant David: ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts: I took you from the pastures, from following the sheep, so that you would be the leader over my people Israel</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I have been with you everywhere that you walked. And I have slain all your enemies before your face.

For you know your servant, O Lord God</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">Because of your word, and according to your own heart, you have done all these great deeds, so that you would make it known to your servant</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">For this reason, you are magnified, O Lord God. For there is no one like you. And there is no God except you, in all the things that we have heard with our own ears</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">But what nation is there upon the earth like your people Israel, because of whom God went forth, so that he might redeem a people for himself, and establish a name for himself, and accomplish for them great and terrible things upon the earth, before the face of your people, whom you redeemed for yourself away from Egypt, the nations and their gods</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">For you have secured your people Israel for yourself, as an everlasting people. And you, O Lord God, have become their God</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now therefore, O Lord God, raise up forever the word that you have spoken over your servant and over his house. And do just as you have said</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">so that your name may be magnified even forever, and so that it may be said: ‘The Lord of hosts is the God over Israel.’ And the house of your servant David will be established in the sight of the Lord</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">For you, O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed to the ear of your servant, saying, ‘I will build a house for you.’ Because of this, your servant has found it in his heart to pray this prayer to you</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now therefore, O Lord God, you are God, and your words shall be true. For you have spoken to your servant these good things</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, begin, and bless the house of your servant, so that it may be forever before you. For you, O Lord God, have spoken. And so, let the house of your servant be blessed with your blessing forever.</li></ol>
