<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">But Jesus continued on to the Mount of Olives</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">And early in the morning, he went again to the temple; and all the people came to him. And sitting down, he taught them</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now the scribes and Pharisees brought forward a woman caught in adultery, and they stood her in front of them</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they said to him: “Teacher, this woman was just now caught in adultery</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such a one. Therefore, what do you say?</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">But they were saying this to test him, so that they might be able to accuse him. Then Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the earth</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And then, when they persevered in questioning him, he stood upright and said to them, “Let whoever is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone at her.</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">And bending down again, he wrote on the earth</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">But upon hearing this, they went away, one by one, beginning with the eldest. And Jesus alone remained, with the woman standing in front of him</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Jesus, raising himself up, said to her: “Woman, where are those who accused you? Has no one condemned you?</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">And she said, “No one, Lord.” Then Jesus said: “Neither will I condemn you. Go, and now do not choose to sin anymore.</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying: “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me does not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so the Pharisees said to him, “You offer testimony about yourself; your testimony is not true.</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">Jesus responded and said to them: “Even though I offer testimony about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">You judge according to the flesh. I do not judge anyone</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when I do judge, my judgment is true. For I am not alone, but it is I and he who sent me: the Father</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">And it is written in your law that the testimony of two men is true</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">I am one who offers testimony about myself, and the Father who sent me offers testimony about me.</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, they said to him, “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered: “You know neither me, nor my Father. If you did know me, perhaps you would know my Father also.</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">Jesus spoke these words at the treasury, while teaching in the temple. And no one apprehended him, because his hour had not yet come</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, Jesus again spoke to them: “I am going, and you shall seek me. And you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you are not able to go.</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so the Jews said, “Is he going to kill himself, for he said: ‘Where I am going, you are not able to go?’ </li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he said to them: “You are from below. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, I said to you, that you will die in your sins. For if you will not believe that I am, you will die in your sin.</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so they said to him, “Who are you?” Jesus said to them: “The Beginning, who is also speaking to you</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">I have much to say about you and to judge. But he who sent me is true. And what I have heard from him, this I speak within the world.</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they did not realize that he was calling God his Father</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so Jesus said to them: “When you will have lifted up the Son of man, then you shall realize that I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but just as the Father has taught me, so do I speak</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he who sent me is with me, and he has not abandoned me alone. For I always do what is pleasing to him.</li><li value="30" id="30" class="svelte-2su5mk">As he was speaking these things, many believed in him</li><li value="31" id="31" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, Jesus said to those Jews who believed in him: “If you will abide in my word, you will truly be my disciples</li><li value="32" id="32" class="svelte-2su5mk">And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.</li><li value="33" id="33" class="svelte-2su5mk">They answered him: “We are the offspring of Abraham, and we have never been a slave to anyone. How can you say, ‘You shall be set free?’ </li><li value="34" id="34" class="svelte-2su5mk">Jesus answered them: “Amen, amen, I say to you, that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin</li><li value="35" id="35" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now the slave does not abide in the house for eternity. Yet the Son does abide in eternity</li><li value="36" id="36" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, if the Son has set you free, then you will truly be free</li><li value="37" id="37" class="svelte-2su5mk">I know that you are sons of Abraham. But you are seeking to kill me, because my word has not taken hold in you</li><li value="38" id="38" class="svelte-2su5mk">I speak what I have seen with my Father. And you do what you have seen with your father.</li><li value="39" id="39" class="svelte-2su5mk">They responded and said to him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus said to them: “If you are the sons of Abraham, then do the works of Abraham</li><li value="40" id="40" class="svelte-2su5mk">But now you are seeking to kill me, a man who has spoken the truth to you, which I have heard from God. This is not what Abraham did</li><li value="41" id="41" class="svelte-2su5mk">You do the works of your father.” Therefore, they said to him: “We were not born out of fornication. We have one father: God.</li><li value="42" id="42" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Jesus said to them: “If God were your father, certainly you would love me. For I proceeded and came from God. For I did not come from myself, but he sent me</li><li value="43" id="43" class="svelte-2su5mk">Why do you not recognize my speech? It is because you are not able to hear my word</li><li value="44" id="44" class="svelte-2su5mk">You are of your father, the devil. And you will carry out the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning. And he did not stand in the truth, because the truth is not in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks it from his own self. For he is a liar, and the father of lies</li><li value="45" id="45" class="svelte-2su5mk">But if I speak the truth, you do not believe me</li><li value="46" id="46" class="svelte-2su5mk">Which of you can convict me of sin? If I speak the truth to you, why do you not believe me</li><li value="47" id="47" class="svelte-2su5mk">Whoever is of God, hears the words of God. For this reason, you do not hear them: because you are not of God.</li><li value="48" id="48" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, the Jews responded and said to him, “Are we not correct in saying that you are a Samaritan, and that you have a demon?</li><li value="49" id="49" class="svelte-2su5mk">Jesus responded: “I do not have a demon. But I honor my Father, and you have dishonored me</li><li value="50" id="50" class="svelte-2su5mk">But I am not seeking my own glory. There is One who seeks and judges</li><li value="51" id="51" class="svelte-2su5mk">Amen, amen, I say to you, if anyone will have kept my word, he will not see death for eternity.</li><li value="52" id="52" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, the Jews said: “Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham is dead, and the Prophets; and yet you say, ‘If anyone will have kept my word, he shall not taste death for eternity.</li><li value="53" id="53" class="svelte-2su5mk">Are you greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? And the prophets are dead. So who do you make yourself to be?</li><li value="54" id="54" class="svelte-2su5mk">Jesus responded: “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me. And you say about him that he is your God</li><li value="55" id="55" class="svelte-2su5mk">And yet you have not known him. But I know him. And if I were to say that I do not know him, then I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and I keep his word</li><li value="56" id="56" class="svelte-2su5mk">Abraham, your father, rejoiced that he might see my day; he saw it and was glad.</li><li value="57" id="57" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so the Jews said to him, “You have not yet reached fifty years, and you have seen Abraham?</li><li value="58" id="58" class="svelte-2su5mk">Jesus said to them, “Amen, amen, I say to you, before Abraham was made, I am.</li><li value="59" id="59" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, they took up stones to cast at him. But Jesus hid himself, and he departed from the temple</li></ol>
