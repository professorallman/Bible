<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">“Amen, amen, I say to you, he who does not enter through the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up by another way, he is a thief and a robber</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">But he who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name, and he leads them out</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when he has sent out his sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">But they do not follow a stranger; instead they flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">Jesus spoke this proverb to them. But they did not understand what he was saying to them</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, Jesus spoke to them again: “Amen, amen, I say to you, that I am the door of the sheep</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">All others, as many as have come, are thieves and robbers, and the sheep did not listen to them</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">I am the door. If anyone has entered through me, he will be saved. And he shall go in and go out, and he shall find pastures</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">The thief does not come, except so that he may steal and slaughter and destroy. I have come so that they may have life, and have it more abundantly</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">I am the good Shepherd. The good Shepherd gives his life for his sheep</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the hired hand, and whoever is not a shepherd, to whom the sheep do not belong, he sees the wolf approaching, and he departs from the sheep and flees. And the wolf ravages and scatters the sheep</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the hired hand flees, because he is a hired hand and there is no concern for the sheep within him</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">I am the good Shepherd, and I know my own, and my own know me</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for my sheep</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I have other sheep that are not of this fold, and I must lead them. They shall hear my voice, and there shall be one sheepfold and one shepherd</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">For this reason, the Father loves me: because I lay down my life, so that I may take it up again</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">No one takes it away from me. Instead, I lay it down of my own accord. And I have the power to lay it down. And I have the power to take it up again. This is the commandment that I have received from my Father.</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">A dissension occurred again among the Jews because of these words</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then many of them were saying: “He has a demon or he is insane. Why do you listen him?</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">Others were saying: “These are not the words of someone who has a demon. How would a demon be able to open the eyes of the blind?</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now it was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem, and it was winter</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico of Solomon</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so the Jews surrounded him and said to him: “How long will you hold our souls in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">Jesus answered them: “I speak to you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in the name of my Father, these offer testimony about me</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">My sheep hear my voice.

For which of those works do you stone me?</li><li value="33" id="33" class="svelte-2su5mk">The Jews answered him: “We do not stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy and because, though you are a man, you make yourself God.</li><li value="34" id="34" class="svelte-2su5mk">Jesus responded to them: “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said: you are gods?</li><li value="35" id="35" class="svelte-2su5mk">If he called those to whom the word of God was given gods, and Scripture cannot be broken</li><li value="36" id="36" class="svelte-2su5mk">why do you say, about him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You have blasphemed,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God?</li><li value="37" id="37" class="svelte-2su5mk">If I do not do the works of my Father, do not believe in me</li><li value="38" id="38" class="svelte-2su5mk">But if I do them, even if you are not willing to believe in me, believe the works, so that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father.</li><li value="39" id="39" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, they sought to apprehend him, but he escaped from their hands</li><li value="40" id="40" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he went again across the Jordan, to that place where John first was baptizing. And he lodged there</li><li value="41" id="41" class="svelte-2su5mk">And many went out to him. And they were saying: “Indeed, John accomplished no signs</li><li value="42" id="42" class="svelte-2su5mk">But all things whatsoever that John said about this man were true.” And many believed in him</li></ol>
