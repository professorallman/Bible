And the disciples were gladdened when they saw the Lord</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, he said to them again: “Peace to you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">When he had said this, he breathed on them. And he said to them: “Receive the Holy Spirit</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">Those whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them, and those whose sins you shall retain, they are retained.</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus arrived</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, the other disciples said to him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I will see in his hands the mark of the nails and place my finger into the place of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will not believe.</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">And after eight days, again his disciples were within, and Thomas was with them.
