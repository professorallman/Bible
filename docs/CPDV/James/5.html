You have stored up wrath for yourselves unto the last days</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">Consider the pay of the workers who reaped your fields: it has been misappropriated by you; it cries out. And their cry has entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">You have feasted upon the earth, and you have nourished your hearts with luxuries, unto the day of slaughter</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">You led away and killed the Just One, and he did not resist you</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, be patient, brothers, until the advent of the Lord.
