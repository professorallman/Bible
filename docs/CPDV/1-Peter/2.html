And whoever will have believed in him will not be confounded.</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, to you who believe, he is honor.

Then he handed himself over to him who judged him unjustly</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">He himself bore our sins in his body upon the tree, so that we, having died to sin, would live for justice. By his wounds, you have been healed</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">For you were like wandering sheep.
