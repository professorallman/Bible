Suspend this head over our walls</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">And, as soon as the sun rises, let everyone take up his weapons and go out to attack, not going down all the way, but only to seem as if making an assault</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then the scouts will have to hurry to awaken their leader for the fight</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when their commanders rush into the tabernacle of Holofernes, and they find his headless body wallowing in his blood, fear will fall over them</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when you realize that they are fleeing, go after them in security, for the Lord will crush them under your feet.</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Achior, seeing the power that the God of Israel had wrought, left behind the rituals of the Gentiles. He believed in God, and he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin, and he was placed among the people of Israel, and so were all the succession of his kindred, even until this present day</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And soon, at the rising of day, they suspended the head of Holofernes above the walls, and every man took up his weapons, and they went out with a great uproar and howling</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">When the scouts saw this, they rushed to the tent of Holofernes</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">Moreover, those who were in the tent came and made a loud noise before the entrance to the bedchamber, hoping to awaken him by an attempt at skillful noise-making, not by intruding on him, so that Holofernes might be roused from sleep</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">For no one dared to knock, or to open and enter, the bedchamber of the powerful leader of the Assyrians</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">But when his commanders and tribunes had arrived, with all the chiefs of the army of the king of the Assyrians, they said to the chamberlains</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">“Enter and awaken him, for the mice have come out of their holes, intending to challenge us to fight.</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Vagao, entering his bedchamber, stood before the curtain, and he made a clapping noise with his hands. For he suspected that he was sleeping with Judith</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">But when, with attentiveness, he perceived no motion of anyone reclining, he approached the curtain. And lifting it up, he saw the dead body of Holofernes, without a head, lying on the ground, soaked in his own blood. He cried out with a loud voice and weeping, and he tore his garments</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he entered the tent of Judith and did not find her. And he ran out to the people</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">and he said: “One Hebrew woman has caused confusion in the house of Nebuchadnezzar the king. For behold, Holofernes lies on the ground, and his head is not with him.</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now when the leaders of the army of the Assyrians had heard this, they all tore their garments, and an intolerable fear and trembling fell over them, and their minds were greatly disturbed</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">And there was an unprecedented outcry in the midst of their camp</li></ol>
