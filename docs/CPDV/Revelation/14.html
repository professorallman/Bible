And no one was able to recite the canticle, except those one hundred and forty-four thousand, who were redeemed from the earth</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">These are the ones who were not defiled with women, for they are Virgins. These follow the Lamb wherever he will go. These were redeemed from men as the first-fruits for God and for the Lamb</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And in their mouth, no lie was found, for they are without flaw before the throne of God</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I saw another Angel, flying through the midst of heaven, holding the eternal Gospel, so as to evangelize those sitting upon the earth and those of  every nation and tribe and language and people</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">saying with a loud voice: “Fear the Lord, and give honor to him, for the hour of his judgment has arrived. And worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the sources of water.</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">And another Angel followed, saying: “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, who inebriated all nations with the wine of her wrath and of fornication.</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the third Angel followed them, saying with a great voice: “If anyone has worshiped the beast, or his image, or has received his character on his forehead or on his hand</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">he shall drink also from the wine of the wrath of God, which has been mixed with strong wine in the cup of his wrath, and he shall be tortured with fire and sulphur in the sight of the holy Angels and before the sight of the Lamb</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the smoke of their torments shall ascend forever and ever. And they shall have no rest, day or night, those who have worshiped the beast or his image, or who have received the character of his name.</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">Here is the patient endurance of the Saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I heard a voice from heaven, saying to me: “Write: Blessed are the dead, who die in the Lord, now and hereafter, says the Spirit, so that they may find rest from their labors. For their works follow them.</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I saw, and behold, a white cloud.
