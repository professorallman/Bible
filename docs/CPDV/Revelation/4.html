And behold, a throne had been placed in heaven, and there was One sitting upon the throne</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the One who was sitting there was similar in appearance to a stone of jasper and sardius. And there was an iridescence surrounding the throne, in aspect similar to an emerald</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">And surrounding the throne were twenty-four smaller thrones. And upon the thrones, twenty-four elders were sitting, clothed entirely in white vestments, and on their heads were gold crowns</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And from the throne, lightnings and voices and thunders went forth. And there were seven burning lamps before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And in view of the throne, there was something that seemed like a sea of glass, similar to crystal.
