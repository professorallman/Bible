And they chose Stephen, a man filled with faith and with the Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas, a new arrival from Antioch</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">These they set before the sight of the Apostles, and while praying, they imposed hands on them</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the Word of the Lord was increasing, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem was multiplied exceedingly. And even a large group of the priests were obedient to the faith</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Stephen, filled with grace and fortitude, wrought great signs and miracles among the people</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">But certain ones, from the synagogue of the so-called Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those who were from Cilicia and Asia rose up and were disputing with Stephen</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">But they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then they suborned men who were to claim that they had heard him speaking words of blasphemy against Moses and against God</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">And thus did they stir up the people and the elders and the scribes. And hurrying together, they seized him and brought him to the council</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they set up false witnesses, who said: “This man does not cease to speak words against the holy place and the law</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">For we have heard him saying that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place and will change the traditions, which Moses handed down to us.</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">And all those who were sitting in the council, gazing at him, saw his face, as if it had become the face of an Angel</li></ol>
