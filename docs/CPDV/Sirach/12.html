For the Most High holds hatred for sinners, but he takes pity on the repentant</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">Give to the merciful, and you should not assist the sinner. For the impious and the sinner will be repaid with the vengeance being held for them on the day of retribution</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">Give to the good, but you should not receive from a sinner</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">Do good to the humble, but you should not give to the impious; withhold your bread, do not give it to him, otherwise he may overpower you with it</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">For you will find twice the evil for all the good you will have done to him. For the Most High also holds hatred for sinners, and he will repay vengeance to the impious</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">A friend will not be known in good times, and an enemy will not be hidden in adversity</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">By the good fortune of a man, his enemies are grieved; and by his misfortune, a friend is revealed</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">You should never trust your enemy.
