<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">Every friend will say: “I also am a close friend.” But there is a friend who is a friend in name only. Is this not a grief even unto death</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">But a companion and friend may turn into an enemy</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">O wicked presumption! From what were you created that you would cover the dry land with your malice and deceitfulness</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">A companion may rejoice with his friend in good times, but in a time of tribulation, he will be an adversary</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">There is a companion who commiserates with a friend for the sake of the stomach, but he will shield himself from the enemy</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">You should not forget your friend in your soul, and you should not be unmindful of him in your wealth</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">Do not choose to consult with someone who waits in ambush for you. And hide your counsel from those who rival you</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">Every counselor offers advice, but some are counselors only for themselves</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">Guard your soul from a counselor. And know beforehand what his interests are. For he will form thoughts from his own soul</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">Otherwise, he may set a signpost in the ground, and he may say to you</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">“Your own way is good.” But then he will stand at a distance to see what befalls you</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">Do not discuss holiness with an irreligious man, nor justice with one who is unjust. You should not speak with a woman about her who is a rival, nor with a coward about war, nor with a merchant about exaggeration, nor with a buyer about selling, nor with a spiteful man about giving thanks</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">nor with the impious about piety, nor with the dishonest about honesty, nor with the field worker about other kinds of work</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">nor with a worker hired for a year about the end of the year, nor with a lazy servant about great works. You should pay no heed to these persons in any matter of counsel</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">But be continually with a holy man, with anyone whom you know to observe the fear of God</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">whose soul is in agreement with your own soul, and who, when you falter in the dark, will share your sorrows</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">And establish a heart of good counsel within yourself. For there is nothing of greater usefulness to you than this</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">At any time, the soul of a holy man declares more truths than seven vigilant watchmen sitting in a high place</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">But concerning all things, pray to the Most High, so that he may direct your way in truth</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">In all your works, let a true word precede you, with steadfast counsel before every deed</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">A wicked word can change the heart. From the heart four kinds of things arise: good and evil, life and death. And the tongue is continually their ruler. There is a man who is an astute teacher of many, and yet this is useless to his own soul</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">A man of experience has taught many, and this is pleasant to his own soul</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">Whoever speaks mere rhetoric is hateful; he will be deceived in every matter</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">Grace is not given to him from the Lord. For he has been deprived of all wisdom</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">There is a wise man who is wise within his own soul, and the fruit of his understanding is praiseworthy</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">A wise man instructs his own people, and the fruit of his understanding is faithful</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">A wise man will be filled with blessings, and those who see will praise him</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">The life of a man is in the number of his days. But the days of Israel are innumerable</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">A wise man will inherit honor among the people, and his name will live in eternity</li><li value="30" id="30" class="svelte-2su5mk">Son, test your own mind in your life, and if it is lacking, you should not give it authority</li><li value="31" id="31" class="svelte-2su5mk">For not all things are fitting for all persons, and not every kind of thing is agreeable to every soul</li><li value="32" id="32" class="svelte-2su5mk">Do not choose to be eager during any feast, and you should not act with excess toward any food</li><li value="33" id="33" class="svelte-2su5mk">For in excessive eating there will be infirmity, and gluttony will continue even unto illness</li><li value="34" id="34" class="svelte-2su5mk">By excessive drinking, many have passed away. But he who abstains will add to his life</li></ol>
