But the Levites did not receive another portion of land, except cities in which to live, and their suburbs, so as to feed their beasts of burden and cattle</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">Just as the Lord had commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did, and they divided the land</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, the sons of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal.

And I nevertheless followed the Lord my God</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Moses swore, on that day, saying: ‘The land that your foot has tread upon shall be your possession, and that of your sons, unto eternity. For you have followed the Lord my God.</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, the Lord has granted life to me, just as he promised, even to the present day. It has been forty-five years since the Lord spoke this word to Moses, when Israel was wandering through the wilderness. Today, I am eighty-five years old</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">being just as strong as I was at that time, when I was sent to explore the land. The fortitude in me at that time continues even until today, as much to fight as to march</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, grant to me this mountain, which the Lord has promised in your hearing also, on which are the Anakim, and cities, great and fortified. Perhaps it may be that the Lord will be with me, and I will be able to destroy them, just as he promised to me.</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Joshua blessed him, and he delivered Hebron to him as a possession</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">And from then on, Hebron was for Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, the Kenizzite, even to the present day.
