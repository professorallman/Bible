Do the work of an Evangelist, fulfilling your ministry. Show self-restraint</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">For I am already being worn away, and the time of my dissolution presses close</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">I have fought the good fight. I have completed the course. I have preserved the faith</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">As for the remainder, a crown of justice has been reserved for me, one which the Lord, the just judge, will render to me in that day, and not only to me, but also to those who look forward to his return. Hurry to return to me soon</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">For Demas has abandoned me, out of love for this age, and he has departed for Thessalonica</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">Crescens has gone to Galatia; Titus to Dalmatia</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">Luke alone is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you; for he is useful to me in the ministry</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">When you return, bring with you the supplies that I left with Carpus at Troas, and the books, but especially the parchments</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">Alexander the coppersmith has shown me much evil; the Lord will repay him according to his works</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">And you should also avoid him; for he has strongly resisted our words</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">At my first defense, no one stood by me, but everyone abandoned me. May it not be counted against them</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that through me the preaching would be accomplished, and so that all the Gentiles would hear. And I was freed from the mouth of the lion</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">The Lord has freed me from every evil work, and he will accomplish salvation by his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory forever and ever.
