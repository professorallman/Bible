<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">And as for you, my son, be strengthened by the grace which is in Christ Jesus</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">and by the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses. These things encourage faithful men, who shall then be suitable to teach others also</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">Labor like a good soldier of Christ Jesus</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">No man, acting as a soldier for God, entangles himself in worldly matters, so that he may be pleasing to him for whom he has proven himself</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then, too, whoever strives in a competition is not crowned, unless he has competed lawfully</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">The farmer who labors ought to be the first to share in the produce</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">Understand what I am saying. For the Lord will give you understanding in all things</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the offspring of David, has risen again from the dead, according to my Gospel</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">I labor in this Gospel, even while chained like an evildoer. But the Word of God is not bound</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">I endure all things for this reason: for the sake of the elect, so that they, too, may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with heavenly glory</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">It is a faithful saying: that if we have died with him, we will also live with him</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">If we suffer, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he will also deny us</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful: he is not able to deny himself</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">Insist on these things, testifying before the Lord. Do not be contentious about words, for this is useful for nothing but the subversion of listeners</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">Be solicitous in the task of presenting yourself before God as a proven and unashamed worker who has handled the Word of Truth correctly</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">But avoid profane or empty talk. For these things advance one greatly in impiety</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">And their word spreads like a cancer: among these are Hymenaeus and Philetus</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">who have fallen away from the truth by saying that the resurrection is already complete. And so they have subverted the faith of certain persons</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the firm foundation of God remains standing, having this seal: the Lord knows those who are his own, and all who know the name of the Lord depart from iniquity</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">But, in a large house, there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also those of wood and of clay; and certainly some are held in honor, but others in dishonor</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">If anyone, then, will have cleansed himself from these things, he shall be a vessel held in honor, sanctified and useful to the Lord, prepared for every good work</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">So then, flee from the desires of your youth, yet truly, pursue justice, faith, hope, charity, and peace, along with those who call upon the Lord from a pure heart</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">But avoid foolish and undisciplined questions, for you know that these produce strife</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">For the servant of the Lord must not be contentious, but instead he must be meek toward everyone, teachable, patient</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">correcting with self-restraint those who resist the truth. For at any time God may give them repentance, so as to recognize the truth</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">and then they may recover from the snares of the devil, by whom they are held captive at his will</li></ol>
