And then he buried them under the terebinth tree, which is beyond the city of Shechem</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when they had set out, the terror of God invaded all the surrounding cities, and they dared not pursue them as they withdrew</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, Jacob arrived at Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, also named Bethel: he and all the people with him</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he built an altar there, and he called the name of that place, ‘House of God.’ For there God appeared to him when he fled from his brother</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">About the same time, Deborah, the nurse of Rebekah, died, and she was buried at the base of Bethel, under an oak tree. And the name of that place was called, ‘Oak of Weeping.</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then God appeared again to Jacob, after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria, and he blessed him</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">saying: “You will no longer be called Jacob, for your name shall be Israel.” And he called him Israel</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">and he said to him: “I am Almighty God: increase and multiply.
