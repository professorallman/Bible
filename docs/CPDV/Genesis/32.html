And now I send an ambassador to my lord, so that I may find favor in your sight.” ’ </li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We went to your brother Esau, and behold, he rushes to meet you with four hundred men.</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">Jacob was very afraid. And in his terror, he divided the people who were with him, likewise the flocks, and the sheep, and the oxen, and the camels, into two companies</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">saying: “If Esau goes to one company, and strikes it, the other company, which is left behind, will be saved.</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Jacob said: “God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Lord who said to me: ‘Return to your land, and to the place of your nativity, and I will do well for you.</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">I am less than any of your compassions and your truth, which you have fulfilled to your servant.

He has sent them as a gift to my lord Esau. And he is also coming after us.</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">Similarly, he gave orders to the second, and the third, and to all who followed the flocks, saying: “Speak these same words to Esau, when you find him</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">And you will add: ‘Your servant Jacob himself also follows after us, for he said: “I will appease him with the gifts that go ahead, and after this, I will see him; perhaps he will be gracious to me.” ’ </li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so the gifts went before him, but he himself lodged that night in the camp</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when he had arisen early, he took his two wives, and the same number of handmaids, with his eleven sons, and he crossed over the ford of Jabbok</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">And having delivered over all the things that belonged to him</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">he remained alone.
