Some little time passed by, while they were held in custody</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they both saw a similar dream on one night, whose interpretations should be related to one another</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when Joseph had entered to them in the morning, and had seen them sad</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">he consulted them, saying, “Why is your expression sadder today than usual?</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">They responded, “We have seen a dream, and there is no one to interpret it for us.” And Joseph said to them, “Doesn’t interpretation belong to God? Recount for me what you have seen.</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">The chief cupbearer explained his dream first. “I saw before me a vine</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">on which were three shoots, which grew little by little into buds, and, after the flowers, it matured into grapes</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the cup of Pharaoh was in my hand.

The three shoots are the next three days</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">after which Pharaoh will remember your service, and he will restore you to your former position. And you will give him the cup according to your office, as you were accustomed to do before</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">Only remember me, when it will be well with you, and do me this mercy, to suggest to Pharaoh to lead me out of this prison</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">For I have been stolen from the land of the Hebrews, and here, innocently, I was cast into the pit.</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">The chief miller of grain, seeing that he had wisely unraveled the dream, said: “I also saw a dream: that I had three baskets of meal above my head</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">and in one basket, which was the highest, I carried all foods that are made by the art of baking, and the birds ate from it.</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">Joseph responded: “This is the interpretation of the dream.
