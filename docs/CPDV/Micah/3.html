And he will hide his face from them in that time, just as they have acted wickedly with their inventions</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">Thus says the Lord about the prophets who seduce my people: They bite with their teeth and preach peace, and if anyone does not give something to their mouth, they sanctify a battle against him</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">Because of this, night will be yours for vision, and darkness yours for divination, and the sun will meet with death over the prophets, and the day will be darkened over them</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And those who see visions will be confounded, and the diviners will be confounded.
