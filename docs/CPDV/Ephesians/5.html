For because of these things, the wrath of God was sent upon the sons of unbelief</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, do not choose to become participants with them</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">For you were darkness, in times past, but now you are light, in the Lord. So then, walk as sons of the light</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">For the fruit of the light is in all goodness and justice and truth</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">affirming what is well-pleasing to God</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead, refute them</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">For the things that are done by them in secret are shameful, even to mention</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">But all things that are disputed are made manifest by the light. For all that is made manifest is light</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">Because of this, it is said: “You who are sleeping: awaken, and rise up from the dead, and so shall the Christ enlighten you.</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, brothers, see to it that you walk cautiously, not like the foolish</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">but like the wise: atoning for this age, because this is an evil time</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">For this reason, do not choose to be imprudent. Instead, understand what is the will of God</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">And do not choose to be inebriated by wine, for this is self-indulgence. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">speaking among yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual canticles, singing and reciting psalms to the Lord in your hearts</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">giving thanks always for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God the Father</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">Be subject to one another in the fear of Christ</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">Wives should be submissive to their husbands, as to the Lord</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">For the husband is the head of the wife, just as Christ is the head of the Church. He is the Savior of his body</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, just as the Church is subject to Christ, so also should wives be subject to their husbands in all things</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the Church and handed himself over for her</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">so that he might sanctify her, washing her clean by water and the Word of life</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">so that he might offer her to himself as a glorious Church, not having any spot or wrinkle or any such thing, so that she would be holy and immaculate</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">So, too, husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">For no man has ever hated his own flesh, but instead he nourishes and cherishes it, as Christ also does to the Church</li><li value="30" id="30" class="svelte-2su5mk">For we are a part of his body, of his flesh and of his bones</li><li value="31" id="31" class="svelte-2su5mk">“For this reason, a man shall leave behind his father and mother, and he shall cling to his wife; and the two shall be as one flesh.</li><li value="32" id="32" class="svelte-2su5mk">This is a great Sacrament. And I am speaking in Christ and in the Church</li><li value="33" id="33" class="svelte-2su5mk">Yet truly, each and every one of you should love his wife as himself. And a wife should fear her husband</li></ol>
