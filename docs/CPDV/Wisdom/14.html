<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">Again, another, thinking to sail, and beginning to make his voyage through the raging waves, calls upon a piece of wood more fragile than the wood that carries him</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">For this is what desire has contrived to be acquired, and the craftsman has formed its understanding</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">But your providence, O Father, governs, because you have provided for both a way in the sea and a very reliable path among the waves</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">revealing that you are able to save out of all things, even if someone were to go to sea without skill</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">But, so that the works of your wisdom might not be empty, therefore, men trust their souls even to a little piece of wood, and, crossing over the sea by raft, they are set free</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">But, from the beginning, when the proud giants were perishing, the hope of the world, fleeing by boat, gave back to future ages a seed of birth, which was governed by your hand</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">For blessed is the wood through which justice is made</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">But, through the hand that makes the idol, both it, and he who made it, is accursed:  he, indeed, because it has been served by him, and it, because, though it is fragile, it is called ‘god.</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the impious and his impiety are similarly offensive to God</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">For that which is made, together with him who made it, will suffer torments</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">Because of this, and according to the idolatries of the nations, there will be no refuge, for the things created by God have been made into hatred, and into a temptation to the souls of men, and into a snare for the feet of the foolish</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">For the beginning of fornication is the search for idols, and from their invention comes corruption of life</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">For they neither existed from the beginning, nor will they exist forever</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">For by the great emptiness of men they came into the world, and therefore their end is soon discovered</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">For a father, embittered with the suffering of grief, made an image of his son, who had been suddenly taken away from him, and then, he who had died as a man, now begins to be worshiped as if a god, and so rites and sacrifices are established among his servants</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then, in the course of time, iniquity gains strength within this erroneous custom, so that this error has been observed as if it were a law, and this figment has been worshiped at the command of tyrants</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">And those, whom men could not openly honor because they were far off, a likeness of them was carried from far off, and from it they made a similar image of the king that they wanted to honor, so that, by their solicitude, they might worship he who was absent, just as if he were present</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">Yet, it passes into their care, and those whom they did not know, they love because of the excellence of the artist</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">For he, wishing to please the one who hired him, embellished his art, so as to fashion a better likeness</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the multitude of men, brought together by the beauty of the work, now considered him to be a god, whom they had formerly honored as a man</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">And this was the deception of human life:  that men, serving either their own inclination or their kings, assigned the unutterable name to stones and wood</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">And it was not enough for them to go astray concerning the knowledge of God, but also, while living in a great war of ignorance, they call so many and such great evils ‘peace.</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">For either they sacrifice their own sons, or they make dark sacrifices, or they hold vigils full of madness</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">so that now they neither protect life, nor preserve a clean marriage, but one kills another through envy, or grieves him by adultery</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">And all things are mixed together:  blood, murder, theft and fraud, corruption and infidelity, disturbances and perjury, disorder within good things</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">forgetfulness of God, pollution of souls, alteration of procreation, inconstancy of marriage, unnatural adultery and homosexuality</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">For the worship of unspeakable idols is the cause, and the beginning and the end, of all evil</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">For they either act with madness while happy, or they insistently speak wild lies, or they live unjustly, or they are quick to commit perjury</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">For, while they trust in idols, which are without a soul, vowing evil, they hope not to be harmed themselves</li><li value="30" id="30" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, from both sides it will fittingly happen, because they have thought evil of God, paying attention to idols, and because they have sworn unjustly, in guile despising justice</li><li value="31" id="31" class="svelte-2su5mk">For swearing is not virtue, but sinning always comes around to a punishment according to the transgression of the unjust</li></ol>
