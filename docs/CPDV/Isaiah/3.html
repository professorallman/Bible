The child shall rebel against the elder, and the ignoble against the noble</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">For a man will apprehend his brother, from the household of his own father, saying: “The vestment is yours. Be our leader, but let this ruin be under your hand.</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">In that day, he will respond by saying: “I am not a healer, and there is no bread or vestment in my house. Do not choose to appoint me as a leader of the people.</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah has fallen, because their words and their plans are against the Lord, in order to provoke the eyes of his majesty</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">The acknowledgement of their countenance is their response.
