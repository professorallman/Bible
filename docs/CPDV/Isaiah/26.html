You will serve peace: peace, for we have hoped in you</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">You have trusted in the Lord for all eternity, in the Lord God almighty forever</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">For he will bend down those living in the heights. He will bring low the lofty city. He will lower it, even to the ground. He will tear it down, even to the dust</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">The foot will tread it down: the feet of the poor, the steps of the indigent</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">The path of the just is upright; the difficult path of the just is right to walk in</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">And in the path of your judgments, O Lord, we have endured for you. Your name and your remembrance are the desire of the soul</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">My soul has desired you in the night. But I will also watch for you with my spirit, in my inmost heart, from the morning. When you accomplish your judgments upon the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn justice</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">Let us take pity on the impious one, but he will not learn justice. In the land of the holy ones, he has done iniquity, and so he will not see the glory of the Lord</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">Lord, let your hand be exalted, and let them not see it.
