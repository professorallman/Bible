One had six wings, and the other had six wings: with two they were covering his face, and with two they were covering his feet, and with two they were flying</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they were crying out to one another, and saying: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts! All the earth is filled with his glory!</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the lintels above the hinges were shaken at the voice of the one crying out.
