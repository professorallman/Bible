Behold, you were sold by your iniquities, and I have dismissed your mother for your wickedness</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">For I arrived, and there was no man. I called out, and there was no one who would hear. Has my hand been shortened and become small, so that I am unable to redeem? Or is there no power in me to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke, I will make the sea into a desert. I will turn rivers into dry land. The fish will rot for lack of water and will die of thirst</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">I will clothe the heavens in darkness, and I will make sackcloth their covering</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">The Lord has given me a learned tongue, so that I would know how to uphold with a word, one who has weakened. He rises in the morning, he rises to my ear in the morning, so that I may heed him like a teacher</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">The Lord God has opened my ear. And I do not contradict him. I have not turned back</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">I have given my body to those who strike me, and my cheeks to those who plucked them.

Therefore, I have set my face like a very hard rock, and I know that I will not be confounded</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">He who justifies me is near. Who will speak against me? Let us stand together. Who is my adversary? Let him approach me</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">Behold, the Lord God is my helper. Who is the one who would condemn me? Behold, they will all be worn away like a garment; the moth will devour them</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">Who is there among you who fears the Lord? Who hears the voice of his servant? Who has walked in darkness, and there is no light in him?
