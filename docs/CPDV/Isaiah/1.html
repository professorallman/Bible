I have nurtured and raised children, but they have spurned me</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">An ox knows his owner, and a donkey knows the manger of his lord, but Israel has not known me, and my people have not understood</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">Woe to a sinful nation, a people burdened by iniquity, a wicked offspring, accursed children. They have abandoned the Lord. They have blasphemed the Holy One of Israel.

The entire head is feeble, and the entire heart is grieving</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">From the sole of the foot, even to the top of the head, there is no soundness within. Wounds and bruises and swelling sores: these are not bandaged, nor treated with medicine, nor soothed with oil</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">Your land is desolate. Your cities have been set ablaze. Foreigners devour your countryside in your sight, and it will become desolate, as if devastated by enemies</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the daughter of Zion will be left behind, like an arbor in a vineyard, and like a shelter in a cucumber field, and like a city being laid to waste</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">If the Lord of hosts had not bequeathed us offspring, we would have been like Sodom, and we would have been comparable to Gomorrah</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">Listen to the Word of the Lord, you leaders of the people of Sodom.

I labor to endure them</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, when you extend your hands, I will avert my eyes from you. And when you multiply your prayers, I will not heed you. For your hands are full of blood</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">Wash, become clean, take away the evil of your intentions from my eyes. Cease to act perversely</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">Learn to do good.

Justice lived in her, but now murderers</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">Your silver has turned into dross. Your wine has been mixed with water</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">Your leaders are unfaithful, the associates of thieves. They all love gifts; they pursue rewards. They do not judge for orphans, and the widowâ€™s case is not brought before them</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">Because of this, the Lord God of hosts, the Strength of Israel, says: Ah! I will be consoled over my enemies, and I will be vindicated from my adversaries</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I will turn my hand to you.
