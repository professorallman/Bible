You descended, and the mountains flowed away before your presence</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">From ages past, they have not heard it, and they have not perceived it with the ears.

And you are our Maker, and we are all the works of your hands</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">Do not be so angry, O Lord, and no longer call to mind our iniquity.
