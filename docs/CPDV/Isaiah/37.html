Therefore, lift up your prayers on behalf of the remnant which has been left behind.</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so the servants of king Hezekiah went to Isaiah</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Isaiah said to them: “You shall say this to your lord: Thus says the Lord: Do not be afraid to face the words that you have heard, by which the servants of the king of the Assyrians blasphemed me</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">Behold, I will send a spirit to him, and he will hear a message, and he will return to his own land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword, in his own land.</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Rabshakeh returned, and he found the king of the Assyrians fighting against Libnah.

And let all the kingdoms of the earth acknowledge that you alone are Lord.</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent to Hezekiah, saying: “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Because of what you have prayed to me about Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">this is the word that the Lord has spoken over him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and mocked you.

And you have said: ‘With a multitude of my four-horse chariots, I have ascended the heights of the mountains adjoining Lebanon. And I will cut down its lofty cedars and its choice pine trees. And I will reach the top of its summit, to the forest of its Carmel</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">I dug deep, and I drank water, and I dried up all the river banks with the sole of my foot.</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">Have you not heard what I have done to it in past times? In ancient times, I formed it. And now I have brought it forth. And it has been made so that the hills and the fortified cities would fight together, unto its destruction</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">Their inhabitants had unsteady hands. They trembled and were confused. They became like the plants of the field, and the grass of the pastures, and like the weeds on the rooftops, which wither before they are mature</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">I know your habitation, and your arrival, and your departure, and your madness against me</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">When you became angry against me, your arrogance rose up to my ears.

And in the second year, eat fruits. But in the third year, sow and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit</li><li value="31" id="31" class="svelte-2su5mk">And what will be saved from the house of Judah, and what is left behind, will form deep roots, and will bear high fruits</li><li value="32" id="32" class="svelte-2su5mk">For from Jerusalem, a remnant shall go forth, and salvation from mount Zion. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this</li><li value="33" id="33" class="svelte-2su5mk">For this reason, thus says the Lord about the king of the Assyrians: He will not enter this city, nor shoot an arrow into it, nor overtake it with a shield, nor dig a rampart all around it</li><li value="34" id="34" class="svelte-2su5mk">He will return on the road by which he arrived.
