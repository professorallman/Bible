What does it mean to you, then, that each of you have even climbed to the rooftops</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">Filled with clamor, a busy city, an exultant city: your dead have not been slain by the sword, nor did they die in battle</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">All your leaders have fled together, and they have been bound by hardship. All who were found were chained together. They have fled far away</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">For this reason, I said: “Depart from me. I will weep bitterly. Make no attempt to console me, over the devastation of the daughter of my people.</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">For it is a day of death, and of trampling, and of weeping to the Lord, the God of hosts, in the valley of vision: examining the wall and the magnificence above the mountain</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Elam took up the quiver and the chariot of the horseman; and he stripped the wall of the shield</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And your elect valleys will be filled with chariots, and the horsemen will position themselves at the gates</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the covering of Judah will be exposed, and in that day, you will see the weaponry of the forest house</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">And you will see breaches in the city of David, for these have been multiplied. But you have gathered together the waters of the lower fish-pool</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">And you have numbered the houses of Jerusalem. And you have destroyed the houses in order to fortify the wall</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">And you have made a pit between two walls for the waters of the ancient fish-pool. But you have not gazed upward to him who made it, and you have not considered, even from a distance, its Maker</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">And in that day, the Lord, the God of hosts, will call to weeping and mourning, to baldness and the wearing of sackcloth</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">But behold: gladness and rejoicing, the killing of calves and the slaughter of rams, the eating of meat and the drinking of wine: “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the voice of the Lord of hosts was revealed in my ears: “Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you, until you die,” says the Lord, the God of hosts</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">Thus says the Lord, the God of hosts: Go forth and enter to him who lives in the tabernacle, to Shebna, who is in charge of the temple, and you shall say to him</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">“What are you here, or who are you claiming to be here? For you have hewn a sepulcher for yourself here. You have diligently hewn a memorial in a rock, as a tabernacle to yourself</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">Behold, the Lord will cause you to be carried away, like a domesticated rooster, and he will remove you, like an outer garment</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">He will crown you with a crown of tribulation. He will toss you like a ball into a broad and spacious land. There you will die, and there the chariot of your glory will be, for it is a shame to the house of your Lord.</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I will expel you from your station, and I will depose you from your ministry</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">And this shall be in that day: I will call my servant Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I will clothe him with your vestment, and I will strengthen him with your belt, and I will give your authority to his hand. And he shall be like a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I will place the key of the house of David upon his shoulder. And when he opens, no one will close. And when he closes, no one will open</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I will fasten him like a peg in a trustworthy place. And he will be upon a throne of glory in the house of his father</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they will suspend over him all the glory of his father’s house: various kinds of vessels and every little article, from the vessels of bowls even to every instrument of music</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">In that day, says the Lord of hosts, the peg which was fastened in a trustworthy place shall be taken away.
