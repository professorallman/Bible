And their horses are flesh, and not spirit. And so, the Lord will reach down his hand, and the helper will fall, and the one who was being helped will fall, and they will all be consumed together</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">For the Lord says this to me: In the same way that a lion roars, and a young lion is over his prey, and though a multitude of shepherds may meet him, he will not dread their voice, nor be afraid of their number, so will the Lord of hosts descend in order to battle upon mount Zion and upon its hill</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">Like birds flying, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem, protecting and freeing, passing over and saving</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">Be converted to the same depth that you have drawn away, O sons of Israel</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">For in that day, a man will cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for you unto sin</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Assur will fall by a sword not of man, and a sword not of man will devour him.
