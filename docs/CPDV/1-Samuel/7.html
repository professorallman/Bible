And the days were multiplied (for it was now the twentieth year) and all the house of Israel rested, following the Lord</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Samuel spoke to the entire house of Israel, saying: “If you would return to the Lord with your whole heart, take away strange gods from among you, the Baals and Ashtaroth, and prepare your hearts for the Lord, and serve him alone. And he will rescue you from the hand of the Philistines.</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, the sons of Israel took away the Baals and Ashtaroth, and they served the Lord alone</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Samuel said, “Gather all of Israel at Mizpah, so that I may pray for you to the Lord.</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they convened at Mizpah. And they drew water, and they poured it out in the sight of the Lord. And on that day they fasted, and in that place they said, “We have sinned against the Lord.” And Samuel judged the sons of Israel at Mizpah</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel had gathered together at Mizpah. And the princes of the Philistines ascended against Israel. And when the sons of Israel had heard this, they were afraid before the face of the Philistines</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they said to Samuel, “May you not cease to cry out to the Lord our God on our behalf, so that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines.</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Samuel took one suckling lamb, and he offered it whole, as a holocaust to the Lord. And Samuel cried out to the Lord on behalf of Israel, and the Lord heeded him</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then it happened that, while Samuel was offering the holocaust, the Philistines began the battle against Israel.
