But Israel also made camp, above the spring which is in Jezreel</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">And indeed, the princes of the Philistines advanced by hundreds and by thousands; but David and his men were in the rear with Achish</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the leaders of the Philistines said to Achish, “What do these Hebrews intend to do?” And Achish said to the leaders of the Philistines: “Could you be ignorant about David, who was the servant of Saul, the king of Israel, and who has been with me for many days, even years, and I have not found within him anything, from the day that he fled to me, even to this day?</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then the leaders of the Philistines became angry against him, and they said to him: “Let this man return, and let him settle in his place, which you appointed for him. But let him not descend with us to battle, lest he become an adversary to us when we begin to fight. For in what other way will he be able to please his lord, except with our heads</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">Is not this the David, about whom they were singing, while dancing, saying: ‘Saul struck down his thousands, but David his ten thousands?’ </li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, Achish called David, and he said to him: “As the Lord lives, you are good and righteous in my sight, even in your departure and your return with me in the military camp. And I have not found anything evil in you, from the day that you came to me, even to this day.

But the leaders of the Philistines have said: ‘He shall not go up with us to the battle.</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, rise up in the morning, you and the servants of your lord who came with you. And when you have risen up in the night, as it begins to be light, go forth.</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so David rose up in the night, he and his men, so that they might set out in the morning.
