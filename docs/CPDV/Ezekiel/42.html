And their doors were toward the north</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">In that place, there were storerooms in the upper part of the lower level. For they supported the porticos, which projected from them out of the lower level, and out of the middle of the building</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">For they were of three levels, and they did not have pillars, as they were like the pillars of the courts.

There they shall station the Holy of Holies, and the offering for sin, and for trespasses. For it is a holy place</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when the priests will have entered, they shall not depart from the holy places into the outer court. And in that place, they shall set their vestments, in which they minister, for they are holy.
