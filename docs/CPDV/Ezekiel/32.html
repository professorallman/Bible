And you brandished a horn among your rivers, and you disturbed the waters with your feet, and you trampled upon their rivers</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">Because of this, thus says the Lord God: I will spread my net over you, with the multitude of many peoples, and I will draw you into my dragnet</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I will throw you upon the land. I will cast you upon the surface of the field. And I will cause all the birds of the air to live upon you. And I will satiate the beasts of the entire earth with you</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I will place your flesh upon the mountains. And I will fill up your hills with your decaying flesh</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I will irrigate the earth with your rotting blood upon the mountains. And the valleys will be filled with you</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I will cover heaven, when you will have been extinguished. And I will cause its stars to grow dark. I will shroud the sun with gloom, and the moon will not give her light</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">I will cause all the lights of heaven to grieve over you. And I will bring darkness upon your land, says the Lord God, when your wounded will have fallen in the midst of the land, says the Lord God</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I will provoke the heart of many peoples to anger, when I will have led in your destruction among the Gentiles, over the lands that you have not known</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I will cause many peoples to be stupefied over you. And their kings will be afraid, with great horror, over you, when my sword will begin to fly above their faces. And suddenly, they will be struck with astonishment, each one concerning his own life, on the day of their ruination</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">For thus says the Lord God: The sword of the king of Babylon will come to you</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">By the swords of the strong, I will cast down your multitude. All these nations are invincible, and they will lay waste to the arrogance of Egypt, and so its multitude will be destroyed</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I will perish all its cattle, which were above the many waters. And the foot of man will no longer disturb them, and the hoof of cattle will no longer trouble them</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then I will cause their waters to be very pure, and their rivers to be like oil, says the Lord God</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">when I will have set the land of Egypt in desolation. And the land will be deprived of her plenitude, when I will have struck all its inhabitants.

Their graves are all around him. All these are uncircumcised and were slain by the sword.

They have been stationed in the midst of the slain</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">Meshech and Tubal are in that place, with all their multitude. Their graves are all around him: all these are uncircumcised, and they were slain and fell by the sword. For they spread their terror in the land of the living</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">But they shall not sleep with the strong, and with those who also fell uncircumcised, who descended to hell with their weapons, and who placed their swords under their heads, while their iniquities were in their bones. For they were the terror of the strong in the land of the living</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, you also will be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and you will sleep with those who were slain by the sword</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">Idumea is in that place, with her kings and all her commanders, who with their army have been given to those who were slain by the sword.
