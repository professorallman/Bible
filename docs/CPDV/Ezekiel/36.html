And you shall be my people, and I will be your God</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I will save you from all your filth. And I will call for grain, and I will multiply it, and I will not impose a famine upon you</li><li value="30" id="30" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the produce of the field, so that you may no longer bear the disgrace of famine among the nations</li><li value="31" id="31" class="svelte-2su5mk">And you shall remember your very wicked ways and your intentions, which were not good. And you will be displeased by your own iniquities and your own crimes</li><li value="32" id="32" class="svelte-2su5mk">It is not for your sakes that I will act, says the Lord God; let this be known to you. Be confounded and ashamed over your own ways, O house of Israel</li><li value="33" id="33" class="svelte-2su5mk">Thus says the Lord God: In the day when I will have cleansed you from all your iniquities, and when I will have caused the cities to be inhabited, and when I will have restored the ruinous places</li><li value="34" id="34" class="svelte-2su5mk">and when the deserted land will have been cultivated, which previously was desolate to the eyes of all who passed by</li><li value="35" id="35" class="svelte-2su5mk">then they shall say: ‘This uncultivated land has become a garden of delight, and the cities, which were deserted and destitute and overturned, have been settled and fortified.</li><li value="36" id="36" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the Gentiles, those who remain around you, shall know that I, the Lord, have built up what was destroyed, and have planted what was uncultivated. I, the Lord, have spoken and acted</li><li value="37" id="37" class="svelte-2su5mk">Thus says the Lord God: Even in this time, the house of Israel shall find me, so that I may act for them. I will multiply them like a flock of men</li><li value="38" id="38" class="svelte-2su5mk">like a holy flock, like the flock of Jerusalem in her solemnities.
