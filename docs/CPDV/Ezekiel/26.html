And I will scrape her dust from her, and I will make her into the barest rock</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">She will be a drying place for nets from the midst of the sea. For I have spoken, says the Lord God. And she will be a spoil for the Gentiles</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">Likewise, her daughters who are in the field will be slain by the sword. And they shall know that I am the Lord</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">For thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will lead into Tyre: Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, a king among kings, from the north, with horses, and chariots, and horsemen, and companies, and a great people</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">Your daughters who are in the field, he will kill with the sword.
