And he continued on and besieged Rabbah. But David was staying in Jerusalem when Joab struck Rabbah and destroyed it</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then David took the crown of Milcom from his head, and he found in it the weight of one talent of gold, and very precious gems. And he made for himself a diadem from it. Also, he took the best spoils of the city, which were very many</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then he led away the people who were in it. And he caused plows, and sleds, and iron chariots to go over them, so much so that they were cut apart and crushed. So did David treat all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And he returned with all his people to Jerusalem</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">After these things, a war was begun at Gezer against the Philistines, in which Sibbecai the Hushathite struck Sippai from the race of the Rephaim, and he humbled them</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">Also, another war was undertaken against the Philistines, in which Adeodatus, a son of the forest, a Bethlehemite, struck the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the wood of whose spear was like a weaverâ€™s beam</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then too, another war occurred in Gath, in which there was a very tall man, having six digits, that is, all together twenty-four. This man too was born from the stock of the Rephaim</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">He blasphemed Israel. And Jonathan, the son of Shimea, the brother of David, struck him down. These were the sons of the Rephaim in Gath, who fell by the hand of David and his servants</li></ol>
