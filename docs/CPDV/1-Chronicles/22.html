But the house that I desire to be built to the Lord ought to be so great that it is renowned in every region. Therefore, I will prepare what will be necessary for him.” And for this reason, before his death, he prepared all the expenses</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he called for Solomon, his son. And he instructed him to build a house to the Lord, the God of Israel</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And David said to Solomon: “My son, it was my will that I build a house to the name of the Lord my God</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the word of the Lord came to me, saying: ‘You have shed much blood, and you have battled in many wars.

Be strengthened and act manfully. You should not fear, and you should not dread</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">Behold, in my poverty I have prepared the expenses for the house of the Lord: one hundred thousand talents of gold, and one million of talents of silver. Yet truly, there is no measuring the brass and the iron. For their magnitude is beyond numbering. And I have prepared the timber and the stones for the entire project</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">Also, you have very many artisans: stoneworkers, and builders of walls, and craftsmen of wood, and those most prudent in doing the work of every art</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">with gold and silver, and with brass and iron, of which there is no number. Therefore, rise up and act. And the Lord will be with you.</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">Also, David instructed all the leaders of Israel, so that they would assist his son Solomon</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">saying: “You discern that the Lord your God is with you, and that he has given you rest on all sides, and that he has delivered all your enemies into your hands, and that the land has been subdued before the Lord and before his people</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, offer your hearts and your souls, so that you seek the Lord your God.
