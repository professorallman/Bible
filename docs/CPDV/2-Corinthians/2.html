Yet, for my part, this is so that I might not burden all of you</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">Let this rebuke be sufficient for someone like this, for it has been brought by many</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">So then, to the contrary, you should be more forgiving and consoling, lest perhaps someone like this may be overwhelmed with excessive sorrow</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">Because of this, I beg you to confirm your charity toward him</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">It was for this reason, also, that I wrote, so that I might know, by testing you, whether you would be obedient in all things</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">But anyone whom you have forgiven of anything, I also forgive. And then, too, anyone I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it was done in the person of Christ for your sakes</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">so that we would not be circumvented by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his intentions</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when I had arrived at Troas, because of the Gospel of Christ, and a door had opened to me in the Lord</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">I had no rest within my spirit, because I was not able to find Titus, my brother. So, saying goodbye to them, I set out for Macedonia</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">But thanks be to God, who always brings triumph to us in Christ Jesus, and who manifests the fragrance of his knowledge through us in every place</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">For we are the sweet fragrance of Christ for God, both with those who are being saved and with those who are perishing</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">To the one, certainly, the fragrance is of death unto death. But to the other, the fragrance is of life unto life. And concerning these things, who is so suitable</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">For we are not like many others, adulterating the Word of God. But instead, we speak with sincerity: from God, before God, and in Christ</li></ol>
