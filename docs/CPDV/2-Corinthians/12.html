<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">If it is necessary (though certainly not expedient) to glory, then I will next tell of visions and revelations from the Lord</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">I know a man in Christ, who, more than fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I do not know, or out of the body, I do not know: God knows), was enraptured to the third heaven</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I know a certain man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know: God knows)</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">who was enraptured into Paradise. And he heard words of mystery, which it is not permitted for man to speak</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">On behalf of someone like this, I will glory. But on behalf of myself, I will not glory about anything, except my infirmities</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">For even though I am willing to glory, I will not be foolish. But I will speak the truth. Yet I will do so sparingly, lest anyone may consider me to be anything more than what he sees in me, or anything more than what he hears from me</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And lest the greatness of the revelations should extol me, there was given to me a prodding in my flesh: an angel of Satan, who struck me repeatedly</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">Because of this, three times I petitioned the Lord that it might be taken away from me</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he said to me: “My grace is sufficient for you. For virtue is perfected in weakness.” And so, willingly shall I glory in my weaknesses, so that the virtue of Christ may live within me</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">Because of this, I am pleased in my infirmity: in reproaches, in difficulties, in persecutions, in distresses, for the sake of Christ. For when I am weak, then I am powerful</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">I have become foolish; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you. For I have been nothing less than those who claim to be above the measure of Apostles, even though I am nothing</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the seal of my Apostleship has been set over you, with all patience, with signs and wonders and miracles</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">For what is there that you have had which is less than the other churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this injury</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">Behold, this is the third time I have prepared to come to you, and yet I will not be a burden to you. For I am seeking not the things that are yours, but you yourselves. And neither should the children store up for the parents, but the parents for the children</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, very willingly, I will spend and exhaust myself for the sake of your souls, loving you more, while being loved less</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so be it. I have not burdened you, but instead, being astute, I obtained you by guile</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">And yet, did I defraud you by means of any of those whom I sent to you</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">I asked for Titus, and I sent a brother with him. Did Titus defraud you? Did we not walk with the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">Have you ever thought that we should explain ourselves to you? We speak in the sight of God, in Christ. But all things, most beloved, are for your edification</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">Yet I fear, lest perhaps, when I have arrived, I might not find you such as I would want, and I might be found by you, such as you would not want. For perhaps there may be among you: contention, envy, animosity, dissension, detraction, whispering, self-exaltation, and rebellion</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">If so, then, when I have arrived, God may again humble me among you. And so, I mourn for the many who sinned beforehand, and did not repent, over the lust and fornication and homosexuality, which they have committed</li></ol>
