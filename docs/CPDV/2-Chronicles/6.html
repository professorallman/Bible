And I have risen up in place of my father David, and I sit upon the throne of Israel, just as the Lord spoke. And I have built a house to the name of the Lord, the God of Israel</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I have placed in it the ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord that he formed with the sons of Israel.</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then he stood before the altar of the Lord, facing the entire multitude of Israel, and he extended his hands</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">For indeed, Solomon had made a bronze base, and he had positioned it in the midst of the hall; it held five cubits in length, and five cubits in width, and three cubits in height. And he stood upon it. And next, kneeling down while facing the entire multitude of Israel, and lifting up his palms towards heaven</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">he said: “O Lord God of Israel, there is no god like you in heaven or on earth.

And you carried out the deed that you promised with your mouth, just as the present time proves</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now then, O Lord God of Israel, fulfill for your servant David, my father, whatsoever you said to him, saying: ‘There shall not fail to be a man from you before me, who will sit upon the throne of Israel, yet only if your sons will guard their ways, and will walk in my law, just as you also have walked before me.</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">And now, O Lord God of Israel, let your word be confirmed that you spoke to your servant David</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">How then is it to be believed that God would dwell with men upon the earth? If heaven and the heavens of the heavens do not contain you, how much less this house that I have built</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">But it has been done for this only, so that you may look with favor upon the prayer of your servant, and on his supplication, O Lord my God, and so that you may hear the prayers which your servant pours out before you</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">and so that you may open your eyes over this house, day and night, over the place where you promised that your name would be invoked</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">and so that you may heed the prayer which your servant is praying within it, and so that you may heed the prayers of your servant and of your people Israel.
