<ol><li value="1" id="1" class="svelte-2su5mk">After these things, the sons of Moab, and the sons of Ammon, and with them some from the Ammonites, gathered together so that they might fight against him</li><li value="2" id="2" class="svelte-2su5mk">And messengers arrived and reported to Jehoshaphat, saying: “A great multitude has arrived against you, from those places that are across the sea, and from Syria. And behold, they are standing together at Hazazon-tamar, which is Engedi.</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Jehoshaphat, being terrified with fear, gave himself entirely to petitioning the Lord, and he proclaimed a fast for all of Judah</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Judah gathered together to pray to the Lord. Moreover, everyone from their cities came to beseech him</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when Jehoshaphat had stood up in the midst of the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, before the new atrium</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">he said: “O Lord, God of our fathers, you are God in heaven, and you rule over all the kingdoms of the Gentiles. In your hand is strength and power, and no one is able to withstand you</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">Did not you, our God, put to death all the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel? And you gave it to the offspring of your friend Abraham, for all time</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they lived in it. And they built a Sanctuary to your name in it, saying</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">‘If evils will have fallen upon us, the sword of judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand in your sight before this house, in which your name is invoked, and we will cry out to you in our tribulations. And you will heed us and accomplish our salvation.</li><li value="10" id="10" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now therefore, behold the sons of Ammon, and of Moab, and mount Seir, through whose lands you did not permit Israel to cross when they were departing from Egypt. Instead, they turned aside from them, and they did not put them to death</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">They are doing the contrary, and they are striving to cast us from the possession which you delivered to us</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, will you, our God, not judge them? Certainly, in us there is not enough strength so that we would be able to withstand this multitude, which rushes against us. But although we do not know what we ought to do, we have this alone remaining, that we direct our eyes to you.</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">Truly, all of Judah was standing before the Lord with their little ones and wives and children</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">But there was Jahaziel, the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite from the sons of Asaph, upon whom the Spirit of the Lord went, in the midst of the crowd</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he said: “Pay attention, all of Judah, and you who live in Jerusalem, and you, king Jehoshaphat. Thus says the Lord to you: Do not be afraid. Neither should you be dismayed by this multitude. For the fight is not yours, but God’s</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">Tomorrow, you shall descend against them. For they will ascend along the incline named Ziz, and will find them at the summit of the torrent, which is opposite the wilderness of Jeruel</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">It will not be you who will fight. Instead, only stand with confidence, and you will see the help of the Lord over you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid. Neither should you be dismayed. Tomorrow you shall go forth against them, and the Lord will be with you.</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Jehoshaphat, and Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell prone on the ground before the Lord, and they adored him</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the Levites from the sons of Kohath, and from the sons of Korah, were praising the Lord, the God of Israel, with a great voice, on high</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when they had risen up in the morning, they went out through the desert of Tekoa. And as they were setting out, Jehoshaphat, standing in their midst, said: “Listen to me, men of Judah and all inhabitants of Jerusalem. Believe in the Lord your God, and you will be secure. Believe in his prophets, and everything will come to prosperity.</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he gave counsel to the people. And he appointed the singing men of the Lord, so that they would praise him by their companies, and so that they would go before the army, and with one voice say: “Confess to the Lord. For his mercy is eternal.</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">And when they had begun to sing praises, the Lord turned their ambushes upon themselves, that is, those of the sons of Ammon, and of Moab, and of mount Seir, who had gone forth so that they might fight against Judah. And they were struck down</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">For the sons of Ammon and of Moab rose up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, so that they might slay and destroy them. And when they had perpetrated this work, now also turning upon themselves, they cut one another with wounds</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then, when Judah had gone to the high point that looks out toward the desert, they saw, from far away, the entire wide region filled with dead bodies. Neither was there anyone who was left alive and had been able to escape death</li><li value="25" id="25" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, Jehoshaphat went, and all the people with him, in order to take away the spoils of the dead. And they found, among the dead bodies, diverse equipment, and also garments, and very precious vessels. And they despoiled these, to such an extent that they were unable to carry everything. Neither could they, over three days, take away the spoils because of the magnitude of the plunder</li><li value="26" id="26" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then, on the fourth day, they were gathered together in the Valley of Blessing. For they had blessed the Lord there, and therefore they called that place the Valley of Blessing, even to the present day</li><li value="27" id="27" class="svelte-2su5mk">And every man of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, returned, with Jehoshaphat before them, to Jerusalem, with great rejoicing. For the Lord had granted to them gladness concerning their enemies</li><li value="28" id="28" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they entered into Jerusalem with psalteries, and harps, and trumpets, into the house of the Lord</li><li value="29" id="29" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands, when they had heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel</li><li value="30" id="30" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was quiet. And God granted to him peace on all sides</li><li value="31" id="31" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. And he was thirty-five years old when he had begun to reign. Then he reigned for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi</li><li value="32" id="32" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he walked in the way of his father, Asa, and he did not decline from it, doing the things that were pleasing before the Lord</li><li value="33" id="33" class="svelte-2su5mk">Yet truly, he did not take away the high places, and the people still had not directed their heart to the Lord, the God of their fathers</li><li value="34" id="34" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the first and the last, have been written in the words of Jehu, the son of Hanani, which he digested into the books of the kings of Israel</li><li value="35" id="35" class="svelte-2su5mk">After these things, Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, formed a friendship with Ahaziah, the king of Israel, whose works were very impious</li><li value="36" id="36" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he was a partner in the making of ships, which would go to Tarshish. And they made the fleet at Eziongeber</li><li value="37" id="37" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then Eliezer, the son of Dodavahu, from Mareshah, prophesied to Jehoshaphat, saying: “Because you have made a pact with Ahaziah, the Lord has struck your works, and the ships have been broken, and they have not been able to go to Tarshish.</li></ol>
