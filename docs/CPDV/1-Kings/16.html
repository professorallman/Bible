In addition, he took as a wife Jezebel, the daughter of Eth-baal, the king of the Sidonians. And he went astray, and he served Baal, and adored him</li><li value="32" id="32" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he set up an altar for Baal, in the temple of Baal, which he had built at Samaria</li><li value="33" id="33" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he planted a sacred grove.
