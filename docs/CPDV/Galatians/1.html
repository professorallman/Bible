Instead, I went into Arabia, and next I returned to Damascus</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">And then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem to see Peter; and I stayed with him for fifteen days</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">But I saw none of the other Apostles, except James, the brother of the Lord</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now what I am writing to you: behold, before God, I am not lying</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">Next, I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">But I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">For they had only heard that: “He, who formerly persecuted us, now evangelizes the faith which he once fought.</li><li value="24" id="24" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they glorified God in me</li></ol>
