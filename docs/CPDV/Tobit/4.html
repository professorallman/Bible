And you shall honor your mother, all the days of her life</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">For you are obliged to be mindful of what great perils she suffered because of you in her womb</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">But when she too will have completed the time of her life, bury her near me</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">Yet, for all the days of your life, have God in your mind. And be careful that you never consent to sin, nor overlook the precepts of the Lord our God</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">Give alms from your substance, and do not turn away your face from any pauper. For so it shall be that neither will the face of the Lord be turned away from you</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">In whatever way that you are able, so shall you be merciful</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">If you have much, distribute abundantly.

For in it, all perdition had its beginning</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">And whoever has done any kind of work for you, immediately pay him his wages, and do not let the wages of your hired hand remain with you at all</li><li value="16" id="16" class="svelte-2su5mk">Whatever you would hate to have done to you by another, see that you never do so to another</li><li value="17" id="17" class="svelte-2su5mk">Eat your bread with the hungry and the needy, and cover the naked with your own garments</li><li value="18" id="18" class="svelte-2su5mk">Set out your bread and your wine at the burial of a just man, and do not eat and drink from it with sinners</li><li value="19" id="19" class="svelte-2su5mk">Always seek the counsel of a wise man</li><li value="20" id="20" class="svelte-2su5mk">Bless God at all times. And petition him that he direct your ways and that all your counsels may remain in him</li><li value="21" id="21" class="svelte-2su5mk">And now, I reveal to you, my son, that I lent ten talents of silver, while you were still a young child, to Gabael, in Rages, a city of the Medes, and I have his written agreement with me</li><li value="22" id="22" class="svelte-2su5mk">And so, inquire how you may travel to him and receive from him the aforementioned weight of silver, and return to him the written agreement</li><li value="23" id="23" class="svelte-2su5mk">Do not be afraid, my son.
