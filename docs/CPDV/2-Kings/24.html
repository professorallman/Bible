And for this reason, the Lord was not willing to be appeased</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the rest of the words of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah? And Jehoiakim slept with his fathers</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Jehoiachin, his son, reigned in his place</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the king of Egypt no longer continued to go out from his own land. For the king of Babylon had taken all that had belonged to the king of Egypt, from the river of Egypt as far as the river Euphrates</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem.

And the city was encircled with fortifications</li><li value="11" id="11" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, went to the city, with his servants, so that he might fight against it</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his leaders, and his eunuchs. And the king of Babylon received him, in the eighth year of his reign</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he took from there all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the house of the king. And he cut up all the gold vessels which Solomon, the king of Israel, had made for the temple of the Lord, in accord with the word of the Lord</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">And he carried away all of Jerusalem, and all the leaders, and all the strong men of the army, ten thousand, into captivity, with every artisan and craftsman. And no one was left behind, except the poor among the people of the land</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">Also, he carried away Jehoiachin into Babylon, and the mother of the king, and the wives of the king, and his eunuchs.
