It will be first in the months of the year</li><li value="3" id="3" class="svelte-2su5mk">Speak to the entire assembly of the sons of Israel, and say to them: On the tenth day of this month, let everyone take a lamb, by their families and houses</li><li value="4" id="4" class="svelte-2su5mk">But if the number is less than may suffice to be able to consume the lamb, he shall accept his neighbor, who has been joined with his house according to the number of souls that may suffice to be able to eat the lamb</li><li value="5" id="5" class="svelte-2su5mk">And it shall be a lamb without blemish, a one year old male. According to this rite, you shall also take a young goat</li><li value="6" id="6" class="svelte-2su5mk">And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month. And the entire multitude of the sons of Israel shall immolate it toward evening</li><li value="7" id="7" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they shall take from its blood, and place it on both the door posts and the upper threshold of the houses, in which they will consume it</li><li value="8" id="8" class="svelte-2su5mk">And that night they shall eat the flesh, roasted by fire, and unleavened bread with wild lettuce</li><li value="9" id="9" class="svelte-2su5mk">You shall not consume anything from it raw, nor boiled in water, but only roasted by fire.

For it is the Passover (that is, the Crossing) of the Lord</li><li value="12" id="12" class="svelte-2su5mk">And I will cross through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man, even to cattle. And I will bring judgments against all the gods of Egypt. I am the Lord</li><li value="13" id="13" class="svelte-2su5mk">But the blood will be for you as a sign in the buildings where you will be. And I will see the blood, and I will pass over you. And the plague will not be with you to destroy, when I strike the land of Egypt</li><li value="14" id="14" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then you shall have this day as a memorial, and you shall celebrate it as a solemnity to the Lord, in your generations, as an everlasting devotion</li><li value="15" id="15" class="svelte-2su5mk">For seven days, you shall eat unleavened bread.

And there arose a great outcry in Egypt. For there was not a house in which no one lay dead</li><li value="31" id="31" class="svelte-2su5mk">And Pharaoh, calling Moses and Aaron in the night, said: “Rise up and go forth from among my people, you and the sons of Israel. Go, sacrifice to the Lord, just as you say</li><li value="32" id="32" class="svelte-2su5mk">Your sheep and herds take along with you, as you requested, and as you go away, bless me.</li><li value="33" id="33" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the Egyptians urged the people to go away from the land quickly, saying, “We will all die.</li><li value="34" id="34" class="svelte-2su5mk">Therefore, the people took bread dough before it was leavened. And tying it in their cloaks, they placed it on their shoulders</li><li value="35" id="35" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the sons of Israel did just as Moses had instructed. And they petitioned the Egyptians for vessels of silver and of gold, and very many garments</li><li value="36" id="36" class="svelte-2su5mk">Then the Lord granted favor to the people in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they bestowed on them. And they despoiled the Egyptians</li><li value="37" id="37" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the sons of Israel set out from Rameses to Soccoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides little ones</li><li value="38" id="38" class="svelte-2su5mk">But also an innumerable mix of common people ascended with them, sheep and herds and animals of diverse kinds, exceedingly many</li><li value="39" id="39" class="svelte-2su5mk">And they baked the bread, which a little while ago they had taken out of Egypt as dough. And they made unleavened bread baked under ashes. For it was not able to be leavened, with the Egyptians compelling them to leave and not permitting them to cause any delay. Neither did they have occasion to prepare any meat</li><li value="40" id="40" class="svelte-2su5mk">Now the habitation of the sons of Israel, while they remained in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years</li><li value="41" id="41" class="svelte-2su5mk">Having been completed, on the same day all the army of the Lord departed from the land of Egypt</li><li value="42" id="42" class="svelte-2su5mk">This night is a worthy observance of the Lord, when he led them out of the land of Egypt. This all the sons of Israel must observe in their generations</li><li value="43" id="43" class="svelte-2su5mk">And the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron: “This is the religious observance of the Passover. No foreigner shall eat from it</li><li value="44" id="44" class="svelte-2su5mk">But every bought servant shall be circumcised, and so he may eat from it</li><li value="45" id="45" class="svelte-2su5mk">The newcomer and the hired hand shall not eat from it</li><li value="46" id="46" class="svelte-2su5mk">In one house it shall be eaten; you shall not carry its flesh outside, nor shall you break its bone</li><li value="47" id="47" class="svelte-2su5mk">The entire assembly of the sons of Israel shall do this</li><li value="48" id="48" class="svelte-2su5mk">And if any sojourner will be willing to cross over into your settlement, and to keep the Passover of the Lord, all his males shall first be circumcised, and then he shall celebrate the rite. And he shall be just like a native of the land. But if any man is not circumcised, he shall not eat from it</li><li value="49" id="49" class="svelte-2su5mk">The law shall be the same for the native born and for the settler who sojourns with you.</li><li value="50" id="50" class="svelte-2su5mk">And all the sons of Israel did just as the Lord had instructed Moses and Aaron</li><li value="51" id="51" class="svelte-2su5mk">And on the same day, the Lord led the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their companies</li></ol>
