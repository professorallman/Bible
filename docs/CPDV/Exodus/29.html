Likewise, the loaves which are in the basket, they shall consume in the vestibule of the tabernacle of the testimony</li><li value="33" id="33" class="svelte-2su5mk">so that it may be an appeasing sacrifice, and so that the hands of those who offer may be sanctified. A stranger shall not eat from these, for they are holy</li><li value="34" id="34" class="svelte-2su5mk">And what may remain until morning, of the consecrated flesh or of the bread, you shall burn these remnants with fire. These shall not be eaten, because they have been sanctified</li><li value="35" id="35" class="svelte-2su5mk">All that I have instructed you concerning Aaron and his sons, you shall do. For seven days shall you consecrate their hands</li><li value="36" id="36" class="svelte-2su5mk">and you shall offer a calf for sin on each day, as an atonement.
