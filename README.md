<p>
    This is the Catholic Public Domain Version (CPDV) of the Holy Bible

This application was written in SvelteKit.

The sqlite database was generated using powershell from the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sbruno/cpdv-json-encoder/src">CPDV JSON source</a>

It is setup in such a way that other translations could be added with some minor modifications to the application
